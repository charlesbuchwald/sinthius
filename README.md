# sinthius
The Museografica EMS.

There are repositories for the separate parts:
- sinthius-frontend for the front end parts.
- sinthius-backend for the back end parts.
- sinthius-installer for the installers for everything.

The main wiki is here, (eventually) containing the roadmap and other high level overviews.

There will (eventually) be a website at http://sinthi.us for marketing and promotion and perhaps with a community forum, but probably no earlier than September 2016.
