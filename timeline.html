<span class="museo p text">
The Neolithic Revolution marked the emergence of agriculture and the lasting socioeconomic and cultural changes that it sowed in human civilization. 
This transition first took root in the Levantine corridor between 10,000 and 8,000 BCE. This is the narrow strip of the Middle East where Africa, Asia, and Europe merge—a region commonly known as the Fertile Crescent.
</br></br>
What occurred in this region soon spread to societies on other continents and would drastically alter the lifestyle and social organization of the groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers who had defined human civilization up to then. This transition took place over the course of thousands of years, crossing cultures and in some cases leading to the domestication of entirely new species of plants.
But how and why did such a dramatic transformation take place? </span>

These climatic changes are thought to have occurred in the
Fertile Crescent when communities of hunter gatherers began
domesticating plants like rye, barley, lentils, chickpeas, and
also cereals like einkorn and emmer—staple crops of early civilization
and close relatives of modern day wheat. These early
civilizations discovered that irrigation techniques and selective
planting of seeds increased the yield of these wild grains. At
the same time, the first domestication of animals like sheep,
goats, pigs, and cattle began.
</br></br>
However, the impact of burgeoning agriculture was not limited
to food cultivation. This was also the start of humans’ experimentation
with modifying their natural environment. These
efforts modified human society as well. Selective breeding
supported surplus food production and populations gradually
began to grow into permanent, centralized communities. This
led to specialized work roles, new social classes, and the
emergence of government, trade and new forms of communication.
</br></br>
The invention of new tools and techniques developed by these
early peoples to promote the cultivation of food also inspired
the formation of new arts and crafts. We can trace the significance
of these changes in the temples, deities, and religious
symbols these societies dedicated to the cultivation of grains.
These early discoveries and experiments marked the start of an
ongoing process of innovation in agriculture that CIMMYT
continues today.</span>

<span class="museo p text">
Wild einkorn, or “single-grain” wheat (Triticum boeoticum) was abundant in the Fertile Crescent since 10,000 BCE. It was found from the Balkans to Iran, primarily in the northern and eastern parts of the Fertile Crescent growing as a weed along paths and fields and is still found in mountain areas of the Middle East.
</br></br>
Wild emmer, or hulled wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) also grew in this region, though it is unique in that it is the only true wild polyploid wheat. Unlike the einkorn wheat which has two sets of chromosomes, wild emmer, which is a hybrid of two other wild species of wheat, has four chromosomes. It is the precursor to the durum and bread wheat varieties commonly used today.
</br></br>
Unlike einkorn, wild emmer does not grow as a weed but as a truly wild plant mostly confined to relatively undisturbed habitats. Therefore, it has not spread much outside of the Fertile Crescent, growing in a region extending from the southern Levant across Israel and Lebanon to southeastern Turkey and across northern Iraq and northwestern Iran. 
Over time, cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of preferred wild grasses led to the development of domestic strains, or mutant forms of wheat with altered characteristics that were again preferentially chosen by farmers. Einkorn and emmer were some of the first subjects of this experimentation.
</br></br>
The high yield and nutritional value of wheat along with its ease of storage and moderately short growing season were undoubtedly factors that contributed to its cultivation.
</br></br>
Another asset was that, like other annual grains, einkorn and emmer are largely self-pollinating. This means that desirable traits manipulated or breeded by humans could be perpetuated with less risk of cross-fertilization with wild plants which might have less desirable traits like smaller seeds or seed heads. 
</br></br>
Other preferable traits were an evenly distributed ripening period and a reduction of the inedible chaff (glumes) that protects the seed kernels and which is separated from seeds during threshing. Domestication also improved the probability of positive yield of the seeds, which under normal circumstances don’t always germinate and form plants. The selected preference towards these or other preferable traits indicates a domesticated variety of cereal. 
Thanks to the observations, imagination, and experimentation of ancient peoples,  human civilization has been forever transformed by two wild grains.

<span class="museo p text columns3">
Both emmer and einkorn wheat share a natural and primitive trait: when mature, the grain of the wild varieties falls to the ground so that it can be spread by the wind. This is because of its fragile rachis, or stem at the very top of the plant where the spikelets, or compartments containing the seeds are held. Those who wish to harvest these grains either have to methodically pick up the grains one by one after they fall to the ground or cut the stem before it ripens. 
However, in wild populations now and then a natural mutation occurs in individual plants: the rachis that supports the cereal doesn’t bend and break when the grain is mature.
If someone is careful to only use these specimens as seed grain they can pass this genetic trait on to new generations of the plant. This is exactly what the first farmers did.
</span>
<span class="museo p text2">
Though einkorn and emmer were essential to humanity for several millennia, they are now only grown commercially in a few places in the world. They have largely been replaced by durum (Triticum durum) used in pasta and bread, and wheat (Triticum aestivum) used in bread and other baked goods, both of which are hybridized forms of different cultivated wheats, which, though lower in nutritional value, produce a higher and more stable yields desirable for feeding the ever growing population dependent on these indispensable grains. Today, bread wheat comprises nearly 90 percent of the wheat produced in the world, and durum accounts for the remaining 10 percent.

<span class="museo p text">
Early farmers discovered a cornucopia when they began domesticating wheat. Active cultivation efforts led to food surpluses that not only provided security, but prompted new social and physical structures to support the harvest of this important crop. 
</br></br>
Hunting and gathering efforts, which required frequent migrations, were gradually directed towards innovations to make the new agriculture more efficient and productive. Tools like the sickle, quern stone, and scratch plow are emblematic of this transition.   
</br></br>
Small villages began to emerge alongside these technological advances. Where necessity once forced groups into nomadic lifestyles, cultivating grains in a fixed location was now a better method for managing their survival. A chain began to emerge: improved technology led to even greater food yields, which promoted a more stable livelihood followed by population growth.   
</br></br>
This shift to a sedentary way of life was perhaps the most iconic change associated with the emergence of agriculture. These first settled communities were incubators for increasingly complex social organization, economic systems, religious beliefs, and artistic practices that germinated into civilizations of proportions and influence not seen before.
