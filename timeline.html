Burgeoning agriculture impacted more than just food cultivation. This was the start of humankind’s experimentation with modifying their natural environment, and in doing so, they began altering human society as well. Selective breeding supported surplus food production and populations gradually began to grow into permanent, centralized communities. This led to specialized work roles, new social hierarchies, and the emergence of government, trade and new forms of communication.

	<span class="museo p text">
	The Neolithic Revolution marked the emergence of agriculture and the lasting socioeconomic and cultural changes that it sowed in human civilization. 
	This transition first took root in the Levantine corridor between 10,000 and 8,000 BCE. This is the narrow strip of the Middle East where Africa, Asia, and Europe merge—a region commonly known as the Fertile Crescent.
	</br></br>
	What occurred in this region soon spread to societies on other continents and would drastically alter the lifestyle and social organization of the groups of nomadic hunter-gatherers who had defined human civilization up to then. This transition took place over the course of thousands of years, crossing cultures and in some cases leading to the domestication of entirely new species of plants.
	But how and why did such a dramatic transformation take place? </span>

GOBEKLI TEPE

Archeologists claim the first permanent buildings were constructed for communal or ritual purposes. An example is Göbekli Tepe (10,000 BCE), the first religious center ever built. The hundreds of massive, T-shaped stone pillars found at this site in the Karacadağ mountain range, which is believed to be the place where wheat was first domesticated, were erected by nomadic groups just before the Neolithic era. </p>

<span class="museo p text">
Wild einkorn, or “single-grain” wheat (Triticum boeoticum) was abundant in the Fertile Crescent since 10,000 BCE. It was found from the Balkans to Iran, primarily in the northern and eastern parts of the Fertile Crescent growing as a weed along paths and fields and is still found in mountain areas of the Middle East.
</br></br>
Wild emmer, or hulled wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) also grew in this region, though it is unique in that it is the only true wild polyploid wheat. Unlike the einkorn wheat which has two sets of chromosomes, wild emmer, which is a hybrid of two other wild species of wheat, has four chromosomes. It is the precursor to the durum and bread wheat varieties commonly used today.
</br></br>
Unlike einkorn, wild emmer does not grow as a weed but as a truly wild plant mostly confined to relatively undisturbed habitats. Therefore, it has not spread much outside of the Fertile Crescent, growing in a region extending from the southern Levant across Israel and Lebanon to southeastern Turkey and across northern Iraq and northwestern Iran. 
Over time, cultivation and repeated harvesting and sowing of the grains of preferred wild grasses led to the development of domestic strains, or mutant forms of wheat with altered characteristics that were again preferentially chosen by farmers. Einkorn and emmer were some of the first subjects of this experimentation.
</br></br>
The high yield and nutritional value of wheat along with its ease of storage and moderately short growing season were undoubtedly factors that contributed to its cultivation.
</br></br>
Another asset was that, like other annual grains, einkorn and emmer are largely self-pollinating. This means that desirable traits manipulated or breeded by humans could be perpetuated with less risk of cross-fertilization with wild plants which might have less desirable traits like smaller seeds or seed heads. 
</br></br>
Other preferable traits were an evenly distributed ripening period and a reduction of the inedible chaff (glumes) that protects the seed kernels and which is separated from seeds during threshing. Domestication also improved the probability of positive yield of the seeds, which under normal circumstances don’t always germinate and form plants. The selected preference towards these or other preferable traits indicates a domesticated variety of cereal. 
Thanks to the observations, imagination, and experimentation of ancient peoples,  human civilization has been forever transformed by two wild grains.

<span class="museo p text columns3">
Both emmer and einkorn wheat share a natural and primitive trait: when mature, the grain of the wild varieties falls to the ground so that it can be spread by the wind. This is because of its fragile rachis, or stem at the very top of the plant where the spikelets, or compartments containing the seeds are held. Those who wish to harvest these grains either have to methodically pick up the grains one by one after they fall to the ground or cut the stem before it ripens. 
However, in wild populations now and then a natural mutation occurs in individual plants: the rachis that supports the cereal doesn’t bend and break when the grain is mature.
If someone is careful to only use these specimens as seed grain they can pass this genetic trait on to new generations of the plant. This is exactly what the first farmers did.
</span>
<span class="museo p text2">
Though einkorn and emmer were essential to humanity for several millennia, they are now only grown commercially in a few places in the world. They have largely been replaced by durum (Triticum durum) used in pasta and bread, and wheat (Triticum aestivum) used in bread and other baked goods, both of which are hybridized forms of different cultivated wheats, which, though lower in nutritional value, produce a higher and more stable yields desirable for feeding the ever growing population dependent on these indispensable grains. Today, bread wheat comprises nearly 90 percent of the wheat produced in the world, and durum accounts for the remaining 10 percent.

The first domestication of einkorn and emmer wheat has been traced to an area of the Levant in the Karacadağ mountains in what is now southeast Turkey, between 8,500–7,000 BCE. What’s even more surprising is that some scientists estimate that it may have only taken 20 to 30 years for these domesticated strains of wheat to be developed.

Whereas hand plows had been used prior, the advent of agriculture brought advances such as the domestication of animals which made preparation of fields for cultivation more efficient. The <strong>scratch plow</strong> (6,000 BCE) is a tool pulled by an animal, which turns over the upper layers of soil, burying weeds and old crops as it brings fresh nutrients to the surface in preparation for sowing a new crop.

The <strong>quern-stone</strong> (8000 BCE), is the oldest known tool used to grind grain into flour.  It was also used to grind fruits, herbs, spices, meats, bark, pigments, and other minerals used for the production of medicines and cosmetics.  It consists of a lower, stationary stone called the quern, and an upper, mobile, swiveling stone called the handstone.

<span class="museo p text">
Early farmers discovered a cornucopia when they began domesticating wheat. Active cultivation efforts led to food surpluses that not only provided security, but prompted new social and physical structures to support the harvest of this important crop. 
</br></br>
Hunting and gathering efforts, which required frequent migrations, were gradually directed towards innovations to make the new agriculture more efficient and productive. Tools like the sickle, quern stone, and scratch plow are emblematic of this transition.   
</br></br>
Small villages began to emerge alongside these technological advances. Where necessity once forced groups into nomadic lifestyles, cultivating grains in a fixed location was now a better method for managing their survival. A chain began to emerge: improved technology led to even greater food yields, which promoted a more stable livelihood followed by population growth.   
</br></br>
This shift to a sedentary way of life was perhaps the most iconic change associated with the emergence of agriculture. These first settled communities were incubators for increasingly complex social organization, economic systems, religious beliefs, and artistic practices that germinated into civilizations of proportions and influence not seen before.

<strong>Catal Hayuk</strong> (7500- 5700 BCE) is one of the most impressive early settlements. Located in what is now Anatolia, in southern Turkey, it may have housed up to 10,000 people and is by far the largest Neolithic settlement found to date. Evidence indicates that the people living here depended equally on hunting as on the cultivation of wheat, barley, peas, and lentils. Though sheep and goats were already domesticated, cattle domestication also began to emerge during this time. 
Catal Hayuk is an example of the dramatic ways agriculture transformed social organization. It could even be considered a small city by today’s standards. Unlike Jerf el Ahmar, Catal Hayuk did not appear to have public buildings. Instead, it was composed of individual, but closely constructed domestic structures each containing cooking ovens and hearths. </p>

The Neolithic Revolution is one of the most significant chapters in the history of humanity. It was during this period that art, trade, government, religion, science, and social structures took on forms that have since come to shape the order of life on this planet.  Without a doubt, agriculture is the spool around which further revolutions of humankind were spun, with wheat at the core of many great civilizations.

<h3>SOCIAL STRATIFICATION</h3>
<p>
As agriculture became the engine behind Neolithic societies, lifestyles were increasingly driven by the shifts of the growing seasons. Increased productivity and larger populations required specialized roles and responsibilities assigned to support this labor, while food surpluses and seasonal cycles meant there was more time for other concerns -no longer did everyone in the village need to dedicate themselves to food collection to ensure the community's survival.  
This development paved the way for social stratification not seen before. Settlements like Catal Hayuk, despite its large population for the time, remained surprisingly egalitarian. However, when significant urbanization took place at the start of the Ubaid period (6500 to 3800 BCE), distinct gender roles and class divisions became increasingly predominant.  
<br><br>
Households that once depended on each other for survival became economically independent and competitive as resources such as access to waterways, land and animal ownership, and trade privileges led to differentiated productivity among groups.  
<br><br>
The emergence of a ruling class enforced and negotiated these divisions. Where decisions had once been made by the collective community, chieftains emerged with the authority to mediate conflicts and oversee economic and religious matters. The chieftains evolved into a ruling class with kings and city-states, and by the time of the Sumerians (5,000 BCE- 1750 BCE), there were governments that drafted contracts, established trade, granted land for irrigation, collected taxes, and enforced laws that safeguarded a clearly defined social order.
