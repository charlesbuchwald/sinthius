<h3 class="orange">CENTRAL HIGH PLATEAU</h3>
<p>As tools and irrigation methods became more sophisticated, agriculture became a central part of the livelihood of nomadic groups in Mesoamerica. This led to food surpluses which encouraged population growth and prompted the emergence of the first permanent settlements around 2300 BCE. This transition took root in the Central High Plateau region of Mexico where access to vital water sources, as well as diverse game for hunting and fishing, encouraged fixed settlements along the lake shores.</p> 

<p>Dwellings made of straw, logs, and mud were grouped together in small villages around which various granaries and hearths were located for storing and preparing food.  These settlements also lay the foundations for the first ceremonial structures. They had a local social and political organization with little hierarchy, and trade between settlements of the Northern (Nexpa, Cuicuilco, Xochipala etal) and Central Plateau (<strong>Monté Alban</strong>, <strong>San Lorenzo</strong>, <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong>, etal) was common. They exchanged raw materials and stones like obsidian which were used for making agricultural tools like axes or decorative items like beads.</p>

<h3 class="orange">OLMEC</h3>
<p>Out of the Central High Plateau arose the notable Olmec culture (1800- 200 BCE) in what is now the south of Veracruz and northern Tabasco regions along the Gulf coast of Mexico. This was considered to be the first civilization in ancient Mexico. By its peak in 700 BCE, urbanization, architectural, and technological innovations illustrate how developments in agriculture prompted an increasingly sophisticated culture that spread over a wide geography.</p> 
<p>The Olmecs established well-planned city-temple complexes like <strong>La Venta</strong> (Tabasco), <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong> (Veracruz), and <strong>San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán</strong> (Veracruz). A priestly class emerged who governed activities related to the veneration of maize and other agricultural symbols which took place in increasingly sophisticated spaces built for ceremonial purposes. Watering and irrigation systems were also developed.</p>

<p>In the western region of the High Plateau, the Chupícuaro culture (800 BCE to 200 CE) established itself along the Lerma River and its tributaries in the modern state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Some groups of nomadic Chichimeca - a diverse group of hunter-gatherers who took advantage of this important water source and shed the nomadic lifestyle, developing agriculture and cultivating maize, beans, and chile.</p> 
<p>They left a diverse array of pottery, often associated with fertility, as well as over ten pyramid temples. During this time, they exercised great influence over a vast territory extending throughout the modern day states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Guerrero, Mexico, Hidalgo, Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, and Zacatecas, possibly even extending as far north as the southern United States. </p>

<h3 class="orange">TEOTIHUACAN, CACAXTLA/XOCITECATL, XOCHICALCO</h3>
<p>The great city of <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (100 CE- 750 CE) highlights the increasing urbanization and complexity of Mesoamerican civilizations. This prominent city, located just north of modern day Mexico City, had a population of more than 125,000 by 500 CE and was among the largest cities in the world at the time. It is no wonder that it was named “birthplace of the gods” and exercised power over the region.</p> 
<p>The complex planning and architecture of the site reflected the increasingly structured cosmogony and ceremonial practices. Along with multi-floor residences housing multiple families, long avenues connected imposing pyramids -  temples dedicated to an expanded pantheon of gods. The impressive Temple of the Sun, dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, is the largest of these structures and the third largest pyramid in the world. Tlaloc was frequently depicted alongside maize which was cultivated using the method of chinampas, or raised farm beds.  </p>
<p><strong>Cacaxtla/Xochitecatl </strong>(650-900 CE) in modern day Tlaxcala is another city of regional influence. It had a population of around ten thousand people and conducted extensive trade with other cultures in farther regions. It contained separate residences for a governing elite, or priestly class, and common people who were usually farmers.   </p> 
<p><strong>Xochichalco</strong> (700- 900 CE), in modern day Morelos, held up to twenty thousand people. It contains an array of pyramid temples of similar style to those of Teotihuacan or the Mayans, indicating the increasing communication and trade between the cultures of Mesoamerica. An astronomical observatory highlights the emerging scientific sophistication.  </p>

<h3 class="orange">TOLTECS</h3>
<p>The militaristic Toltecs (900-1150 CE) based in modern day Hidalgo, replaced Teotihuacán as the dominant city in the region and held influence over a vast portion of southern and central Mexico. Descending from groups of Chichimeca who settled in the region, the Toltecs constructed impressive cities such as Tula, a capital with up to thirty thousand residents, impressive monuments and temples, and dense housing units. Close similarities to the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá point to exchange between these two Mesoamerican empires.</p> 
<p>The Toltecs were known for their impressive maize productivity, and a drying climate was part of the reason for their downfall. They were greatly admired by the later Mexica groups that came to be known as the Aztec Empire.</p>

<h3 class="orange">MAYA</h3>
<p>The Maya civilization was one of the most prominent and enduring Mesoamerican cultures. It spanned nearly two thousand five hundred years, emerging alongside agriculture around 2000 BCE and remaining a regional power up until 1697 CE with the Spanish conquest. Maya cities like Chichén Itzá are known for their monumental architecture, but unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, their population centers were not cohesively linked into one empire. Instead, a variety of states and chiefdoms frequently competed with one another. Their culture was highly hierarchical, with a divine king who derived power from the maize gods. A sociopolitical and military elite occupied administrative buildings which were located at the heart of Maya cities and often served ceremonial purposes associated with religion and seasonal celebrations of maize. Residential areas where farmers and other artisans lived extended outward from the monumental center. Though these laborers constituted ninety percent of the population, they were at the bottom of the social hierarchy.</p> 
<p>The Maya were great innovators: their many accomplishments range from a sophisticated calendar and astronomy to one of the most sophisticated ancient written languages, among many others. Although they traded extensively and over vast regions of Central and Mesoamerica, agriculture was a central feature of their economy. They are also renowned for farming methods such as the <em>milpa</em> system and irrigation techniques accomplished by tapping local underground caves called <em>cenotes</em>. </p>

<h3 class="orange">MEXICA</h3>
<p>The Mexica civilization, commonly referred to as the Aztec empire, were another prominent civilization that arose, though much later than the Maya. The Mexica were the last of a series of Nahuatl-speaking peoples who moved from the north into the Valley of Mexico around the thirteenth century. Through a series of conquests, their capital of Tenochtitlán-- the now dry lake bed where Mexico City stands-- became part of a triple alliance of city-states which governed a vast expanse of central Mexico up until the time of the Spanish conquest in 1521. These city-states formed a hegemonic military confederation known for its violent conquest of other regions.  Political power was divided between supreme rulers in the capital, military executives, and provincial rulers in conquered city states that paid tributes to the main governing body. A judicial system was established to decide matters pertaining to social, economic, and military laws.</p> 
<p>The cultivation of maize was equally woven through Mexica society. They continued using the <em>chinampa</em> method begun in Teotihuacan to cultivate this important crop, which was celebrated for nearly three sacred calendar months every year. Mexica cities were noted for their large plazas in front of the temples that celebrated deities including the multiple gods dedicated to maize. </p>

<h3 class="orange">MOCHICA - CHIMU</h3>
<p>As agriculture prompted the emergence of settlements, cities, and empires in Mesoamerica, maize became a cornerstone of the agricultural societies of the Andean region of South America. Since its arrival to modern day Peru and Bolivia around 3,000 BCE, maize was widely grown and formed a fundamental part of the diet.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Moche culture</strong> (100 - 800 CE), located in northern Peru, were renowned for their irrigation system based on canals which fertilized the arid terrain that sustained agriculture. The Chimú culture (1150- 1450) further expanded this into a large-scale irrigation system which was the basis for political and social organization throughout the region.They formed a loose confederation of cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru and southern Ecuador, which operated under a hierarchical governing system. The rulers of the capital, <strong>Chan-Chan</strong>, decided issues of labor and canal construction which sustained the cultivation of crops like beans, papaya, sweet potato, cotton and maize. This social division was evident in the construction of walled-in palaces with courtyards, separating monumental buildings and the residences of rulers from those of the common population --the farmers, artisans, traders, and fishermen who lived on the outer edges of the city.  </p>

<h3 class="orange">INCA</h3>
<p>The <strong>Inca civilization</strong> (around 1200-1572 CE) established the largest empire in all of Pre-Columbian America. The capital, Cusco, in modern day Peru, contained up to 300,000 residents at its peak and was a city of bureaucrats, guards, servant-slaves, and laborers brought in from conquered territories. The Inca dominated over a vast region extending down the Andean mountains and including large parts of modern Ecuador, Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and a small part of Columbia.</p> 
<p>The Inca empire was ruled like a modern federal system, with strong powers in Cusco and regional governments in the four sections of the empire communicating back to the capital. A tax system was in place as well as a standing military composed of male heads of household who were required to serve.</p>
<p>Cities like Machu Picchu, built high in the Andes mountains are emblematic of the technological and organizational feats of the Incas. An extensive network of roads was constructed to allow for the transportation of food and goods throughout the empire. They also created a complex system of terracing, canals, irrigation networks, and draining of wetlands in order to sustain farming in an otherwise mountainous terrain. The Incas were fully aware of the values of regular crop rotation and fertilized land with dried llama dung and other animal remains. In addition to a highly orchestrated system of food storage centers called <strong><em>qollqas</em></strong>, which were built in the tens of thousands along roadsides in the empire, the Inca relied heavily on manual tools like foot ploughs, hoes, and clod busters to harvest staple crops like maize. </p>
