<p>Though maize-like plants derived from teosinte were cultivated since 5,000 BCE, the earliest corn cob dates to around 4,250 BCE, found at the <strong>Guila Naquitz Cave</strong> in the Oaxaca Valley. Early maize (Zea species) pollen dating back to 5100 BCE has been found at the Olmec archeological site at San Andres, Tabasco in south-western Mexico. By 3,000 BCE, there is evidence of maize cultivation in South America, and by 2100 BCE it was introduced to the southwestern United States in areas of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>
