<h3><p>MOCHICA, CHIMU. PERU</p></h3>

<body>
<p>As agriculture prompted the emergence of settlements, cities, and empires in Mesoamerica, maize became a cornerstone of the agricultural societies of the Andean region of South America. Since its arrival to modern day Peru and Bolivia around 3,000 BCE, maize was widely grown and formed a fundamental part of the diet.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Moche culture</strong> (100 - 800 CE), located in northern Peru, were renowned for their irrigation system based on canals which fertilized the arid terrain that sustained agriculture. The Chim√∫ culture (1150- 1450) further expanded this into a large-scale irrigation system which was the basis for political and social organization throughout the region.They formed a loose confederation of cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru and southern Ecuador, which operated under a hierarchical governing system. The rulers of the capital, <strong>Chan-Chan</strong>, decided issues of labor and canal construction which sustained the cultivation of crops like beans, papaya, sweet potato, cotton and maize. This social division was evident in the construction of walled-in palaces with courtyards, separating monumental buildings and the residences of rulers from those of the common population --the farmers, artisans, traders, and fishermen who lived on the outer edges of the city.  </p>
