<h2><p>OF MAIZE</p></h2>

<body>

<p>The discovery of America in 1492 and its subsequent colonization represented to the Europeans the fulfillment and generation of great wealth, including the crops and foods that helped to prevent hunger in various parts of the world.  Among these riches was maize, brought to Europe, to Africa (linked to the slave trade), to the Philippines, to China (by the commercial exchange named the Nao of China) and to India at the start of the sixteenth century. </p>

<p>In all of these regions, since the sixteenth century, maize was well received. In Africa it became a crop of great significance. In India it was rapidly integrated into the gastronomy, along with the chile and the tomato. Thus, by the seventeenth century it was already known and cultivated throughout almost the entire world. Today it dominates large portions of European agriculture, especially for animal feed. The broad and rapid spread of maize prompted a loss of memory on its origins and founders; even today it accrues names like the Turkish grain, Asian fruit, Indian grain, or grain of the Mecca.</p>

<p>Maize is the name of the plant in Spanish. In Nahuatl it is known as teocintle, tlayoli, centli, centi, or cintle;  in Maya, ixi;  in Huasteco, izis; in Otomí or Hñahñu, detha; in Tarasco, xanini or ahtziri; in Quechua, pirissincu; and in Guaraní, abatí.</p>
