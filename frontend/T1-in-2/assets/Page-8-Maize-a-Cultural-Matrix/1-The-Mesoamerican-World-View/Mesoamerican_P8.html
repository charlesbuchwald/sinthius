<h3><p>THE MESOAMERICAN WORLD VIEW</p></h3>

<p>Mesoamerican religions granted great importance to the worship of nature and maize; the saying <em>“(wo)men of maize”</em> is apt as mankind feeds from the grain, which in turn serves as the base for their civilisations. The structure of a life of maize builds upon worldview that organises time and space, and whose recurrent metaphor is this sacred plant’s cycle of life. In this way, deities, rites and ceremonies, festivities and participants, are linked with nature’s rhythms, the cycle of the land and its product: maize.</p>

<p>Evidence testifies to the flourishing of these societies, which while maintaining their local peculiarities, remained strongly tied to a common history: the agrarian tradition associated to the milpa way of farming (maize - beans - squash), the binding worldviews, and the presence of similar deities in their religious pantheons. According to the Toltec, Zapotec, Mexica or Maya foundational myths, maize (the matter from which mankind was created) is a divine gift. Therefore, the gods that created it were the object of worship expressed in countless representations. In this way, by cultivating maize, Mesoamerican men and women cultivated themselves.</p>
