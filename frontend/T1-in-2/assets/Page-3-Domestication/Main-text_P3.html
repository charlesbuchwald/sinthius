<h1><p>DOMESTICATION</p></h1>
<h2>OF MAIZE</h2>
<p>Archeologists believe that maize was first domesticated between 10,000 and 5,500 BCE by nomadic groups who settled along the Balsas river basin--a region that spans the current south-central Mexican states of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Mexico. This transition occurred simultaneously in other communities and may have extended as far south as northern Nicaragua. From these regions, maize rapidly spread throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of maize in historical record challenges the notion that evolution involves gradual changes over long periods of time. Genetic consistency between maize varieties proves that modern varieties descend from a single ancestor. Unlike other plants such as wheat and rice, maize has no obvious wild relatives. It exists only as a cultivated crop that without human intervention to remove and distribute the seeds, they would fall to the ground still attached to the cob and germinate at the same time and place, competing for sunlight and nutrients such that few would survive.</p>

<p>Scientists now believe that the wild ancestor of maize is the <strong>teosinte plant (+)</strong> which means grain of god in Nahuatl.</p>
