<h1><p>THE MILPA: </p></h1>
<h2><p>THE BASIS FOR A BALANCED DIET</p></h2>

<body>

<p>On a nutritional level, the four plants present in the milpa complement each other to offer a diet balanced in amino-acids (granted by maize and beans) and niacin, in carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and fibre (given by squash) and in the many vitamins (granted by chile). Added to this are the nutrients offered by numerous other plants associated with the milpa such as melon, tomatoes, chilis, sweet potato, jícama, amaranth and mucuna, which envelop an entire orchard and is an adequate way to grow “a bit of everything for the table”.</p>
