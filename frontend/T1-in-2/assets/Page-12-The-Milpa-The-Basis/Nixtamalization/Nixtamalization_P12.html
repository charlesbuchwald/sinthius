<p>The treatment of maize with lime, or the hulled of the plant, is important to increase its nutritional value. The exterior covering of the grain is eliminated so that it does not produce indigestion or interferes with the assimilation of other nutrients. The lime and heat used to elaborate the nixtamal provoke chemicals in the maize, and improve its quality by making it more digestible. Nixtamalization significantly improves the bioavailability of calcium and amino-acids. It also represented a technological revolution that allowed Mesoamerican people to improve its quality as food.</p>
