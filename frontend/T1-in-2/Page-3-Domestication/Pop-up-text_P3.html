<body>Teosinte <em>(Zea mays L. ssp. Parviglumis)</em> is a wild grass that is found  in southern Mexico and Central America. It commonly grows as a wild plant along streams and on hillsides, although it can also invade cultivated fields as a weed. Though Teosinte looks very different from maize <em>(Zea mays L)</em>, it shares certain structural and genetic similarities. Teosinte can cross-breed with modern maize varieties to form maize-teosinte hybrids that can go on to reproduce naturally. However, the edible portion of wild teosinte is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard shell.
