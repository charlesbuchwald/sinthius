	The story of maize and mankind began ten thousand years ago in the Americas. Maize was the common thread guiding the evolution of Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations

	and the new social and economic orders that distinguished them. The introduction of maize and agriculture by pre-hispanic groups left a lasting mark on religion, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, art and agriculture. It is hard to imagine the progress of these cultures without this important plant that became the center of agriculture on the continent. Today maize, along with wheat and rice, is one of the three most widely cultivated grains in the world. It links future generations around the world to the innovation of pre-hispanic farmers.

<p>The first settlers began their journey forty thousand years ago. These nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Strait and moved toward less frigid lands south in the American continent. Between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE however, profound climate changes combined with widespread hunting prompted the extinction of large mammals that once populated the American continent such as mammoths, camel, horses, bison, and mastodons.</p>
<br><br>
<p>These changes led nomadic groups to gradually turn to agriculture, forming small, sedentary communities where, alongside hunting, gathering and fishing, they cultivated and eventually domesticated many of the native plants that are still central to the Mesoamerican diet today—squash, beans, amaranth, and chile plus potatoes and quinoa in the Andean region. Thanks to the ingenuity of the first Mesoamerican farmers, maize would become one of the most important plants in this diverse region and later, in the rest of the world.</p>

	<p>Archeologists believe that maize was first domesticated between 10,000 and 5,500 BCE by nomadic groups who settled along the Balsas river basin--a region that spans the current south-central Mexican states of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Mexico. This transition occurred simultaneously in other communities and may have extended as far south as northern Nicaragua. From these regions, maize rapidly spread throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of maize in historical record challenges the notion that evolution involves gradual changes over long periods of time. Genetic consistency between maize varieties proves that modern varieties descend from a single ancestor. Unlike other plants such as wheat and rice, maize has no obvious wild relatives. It exists only as a cultivated crop that without human intervention to remove and distribute the seeds, they would fall to the ground still attached to the cob and germinate at the same time and place, competing for sunlight and nutrients such that few would survive.</p>

<p>Scientists now believe that the wild ancestor of maize is the <strong>teosinte plant (+)</strong> which means grain of god in Nahuatl.</p>

By 3,000 BCE, there is evidence of maize cultivation in South America, and by 2100 BCE it was introduced to the southwestern United States in areas of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

	<p>In large parts of the current Mexican and Central American territory- a region now known as Mesoamerica- one of the most complex civilisation centres in the history of humankind developed. Those ancient civilisations, much like those of today, were sustained by maize. The permanence of the crop and the culture of maize is one of the links that join the past, present, and surely the future of the groups of people living in these regions.</p> 

<p>Maize was at the center of the Mesoamerican diet: the relationship between these men and women growing this plant gave rise to a common history based on a shared worldview and forms of social organisation that revolved around agriculture. The history of the men and women of these lands with this sacred plant can be synthesised into a phrase that distinguishes them: <em>“We are made of maize… we are people of maize.”</em></p>

<h3 class="orange">CENTRAL HIGH PLATEAU</h3>
<p>As tools and irrigation methods became more sophisticated, agriculture became a central part of the livelihood of nomadic groups in Mesoamerica. This led to food surpluses which encouraged population growth and prompted the emergence of the first permanent settlements around 2300 BCE. This transition took root in the Central High Plateau region of Mexico where access to vital water sources, as well as diverse game for hunting and fishing, encouraged fixed settlements along the lake shores.</p> 

<p>Dwellings made of straw, logs, and mud were grouped together in small villages around which various granaries and hearths were located for storing and preparing food.  These settlements also lay the foundations for the first ceremonial structures. They had a local social and political organization with little hierarchy, and trade between settlements of the Northern (Nexpa, Cuicuilco, Xochipala etal) and Central Plateau (<strong>Monté Alban</strong>, <strong>San Lorenzo</strong>, <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong>, etal) was common. They exchanged raw materials and stones like obsidian which were used for making agricultural tools like axes or decorative items like beads.</p>

<p>Out of the Central High Plateau arose the notable Olmec culture (1800- 200 BCE) in what is now the south of Veracruz and northern Tabasco regions along the Gulf coast of Mexico. This was considered to be the first civilization in ancient Mexico. By its peak in 700 BCE, urbanization, architectural, and technological innovations illustrate how developments in agriculture prompted an increasingly sophisticated culture that spread over a wide geography.</p> 
<p>The Olmecs established well-planned city-temple complexes like <strong>La Venta</strong> (Tabasco), <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong> (Veracruz), and <strong>San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán</strong> (Veracruz). A priestly class emerged who governed activities related to the veneration of maize and other agricultural symbols which took place in increasingly sophisticated spaces built for ceremonial purposes. Watering and irrigation systems were also developed.</p>

<p>In the western region of the High Plateau, the Chupícuaro culture (800 BCE to 200 CE) established itself along the Lerma River and its tributaries in the modern state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Some groups of nomadic Chichimeca - a diverse group of hunter-gatherers who took advantage of this important water source and shed the nomadic lifestyle, developing agriculture and cultivating maize, beans, and chile.</p> 
<p>They left a diverse array of pottery, often associated with fertility, as well as over ten pyramid temples. During this time, they exercised great influence over a vast territory extending throughout the modern day states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Guerrero, Mexico, Hidalgo, Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, and Zacatecas, possibly even extending as far north as the southern United States. </p>

<h3 class="orange">TEOTIHUACAN, CACAXTLA/XOCITECATL, XOCHICALCO</h3>
<p>The great city of <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (100 CE- 750 CE) highlights the increasing urbanization and complexity of Mesoamerican civilizations. This prominent city, located just north of modern day Mexico City, had a population of more than 125,000 by 500 CE and was among the largest cities in the world at the time. It is no wonder that it was named “birthplace of the gods” and exercised power over the region.</p> 
<p>The complex planning and architecture of the site reflected the increasingly structured cosmogony and ceremonial practices. Along with multi-floor residences housing multiple families, long avenues connected imposing pyramids -  temples dedicated to an expanded pantheon of gods. The impressive Temple of the Sun, dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, is the largest of these structures and the third largest pyramid in the world. Tlaloc was frequently depicted alongside maize which was cultivated using the method of chinampas, or raised farm beds.  </p>
<p><strong>Cacaxtla/Xochitecatl </strong>(650-900 CE) in modern day Tlaxcala is another city of regional influence. It had a population of around ten thousand people and conducted extensive trade with other cultures in farther regions. It contained separate residences for a governing elite, or priestly class, and common people who were usually farmers.   </p> 
<p><strong>Xochichalco</strong> (700- 900 CE), in modern day Morelos, held up to twenty thousand people. It contains an array of pyramid temples of similar style to those of Teotihuacan or the Mayans, indicating the increasing communication and trade between the cultures of Mesoamerica. An astronomical observatory highlights the emerging scientific sophistication.  </p>

<p>The militaristic Toltecs (900-1150 CE) based in modern day Hidalgo, replaced Teotihuacán as the dominant city in the region and held influence over a vast portion of southern and central Mexico. Descending from groups of Chichimeca who settled in the region, the Toltecs constructed impressive cities such as Tula, a capital with up to thirty thousand residents, impressive monuments and temples, and dense housing units. Close similarities to the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá point to exchange between these two Mesoamerican empires.</p> 
<p>The Toltecs were known for their impressive maize productivity, and a drying climate was part of the reason for their downfall. They were greatly admired by the later Mexica groups that came to be known as the Aztec Empire.</p>

<h3 class="orange">MAYA</h3>
<p>The Maya civilization was one of the most prominent and enduring Mesoamerican cultures. It spanned nearly two thousand five hundred years, emerging alongside agriculture around 2000 BCE and remaining a regional power up until 1697 CE with the Spanish conquest. Maya cities like Chichén Itzá are known for their monumental architecture, but unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, their population centers were not cohesively linked into one empire. Instead, a variety of states and chiefdoms frequently competed with one another. Their culture was highly hierarchical, with a divine king who derived power from the maize gods. A sociopolitical and military elite occupied administrative buildings which were located at the heart of Maya cities and often served ceremonial purposes associated with religion and seasonal celebrations of maize. Residential areas where farmers and other artisans lived extended outward from the monumental center. Though these laborers constituted ninety percent of the population, they were at the bottom of the social hierarchy.</p> 
<p>The Maya were great innovators: their many accomplishments range from a sophisticated calendar and astronomy to one of the most sophisticated ancient written languages, among many others. Although they traded extensively and over vast regions of Central and Mesoamerica, agriculture was a central feature of their economy. They are also renowned for farming methods such as the <em>milpa</em> system and irrigation techniques accomplished by tapping local underground caves called <em>cenotes</em>. </p>

<h3 class="orange">MEXICA</h3>
<p>The Mexica civilization, commonly referred to as the Aztec empire, were another prominent civilization that arose, though much later than the Maya. The Mexica were the last of a series of Nahuatl-speaking peoples who moved from the north into the Valley of Mexico around the thirteenth century. Through a series of conquests, their capital of Tenochtitlán-- the now dry lake bed where Mexico City stands-- became part of a triple alliance of city-states which governed a vast expanse of central Mexico up until the time of the Spanish conquest in 1521. These city-states formed a hegemonic military confederation known for its violent conquest of other regions.  Political power was divided between supreme rulers in the capital, military executives, and provincial rulers in conquered city states that paid tributes to the main governing body. A judicial system was established to decide matters pertaining to social, economic, and military laws.</p> 
<p>The cultivation of maize was equally woven through Mexica society. They continued using the <em>chinampa</em> method begun in Teotihuacan to cultivate this important crop, which was celebrated for nearly three sacred calendar months every year. Mexica cities were noted for their large plazas in front of the temples that celebrated deities including the multiple gods dedicated to maize. </p>

<h3 class="orange">MOCHICA - CHIMU</h3>
<p>As agriculture prompted the emergence of settlements, cities, and empires in Mesoamerica, maize became a cornerstone of the agricultural societies of the Andean region of South America. Since its arrival to modern day Peru and Bolivia around 3,000 BCE, maize was widely grown and formed a fundamental part of the diet.</p> 
<p>The <strong>Moche culture</strong> (100 - 800 CE), located in northern Peru, were renowned for their irrigation system based on canals which fertilized the arid terrain that sustained agriculture. The Chimú culture (1150- 1450) further expanded this into a large-scale irrigation system which was the basis for political and social organization throughout the region.They formed a loose confederation of cities scattered along the coast of northern Peru and southern Ecuador, which operated under a hierarchical governing system. The rulers of the capital, <strong>Chan-Chan</strong>, decided issues of labor and canal construction which sustained the cultivation of crops like beans, papaya, sweet potato, cotton and maize. This social division was evident in the construction of walled-in palaces with courtyards, separating monumental buildings and the residences of rulers from those of the common population --the farmers, artisans, traders, and fishermen who lived on the outer edges of the city.  </p>

<h3 class="orange">INCA</h3>
<p>The <strong>Inca civilization</strong> (around 1200-1572 CE) established the largest empire in all of Pre-Columbian America. The capital, Cusco, in modern day Peru, contained up to 300,000 residents at its peak and was a city of bureaucrats, guards, servant-slaves, and laborers brought in from conquered territories. The Inca dominated over a vast region extending down the Andean mountains and including large parts of modern Ecuador, Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and a small part of Columbia.</p> 
<p>The Inca empire was ruled like a modern federal system, with strong powers in Cusco and regional governments in the four sections of the empire communicating back to the capital. A tax system was in place as well as a standing military composed of male heads of household who were required to serve.</p>
<p>Cities like Machu Picchu, built high in the Andes mountains are emblematic of the technological and organizational feats of the Incas. An extensive network of roads was constructed to allow for the transportation of food and goods throughout the empire. They also created a complex system of terracing, canals, irrigation networks, and draining of wetlands in order to sustain farming in an otherwise mountainous terrain. The Incas were fully aware of the values of regular crop rotation and fertilized land with dried llama dung and other animal remains. In addition to a highly orchestrated system of food storage centers called <strong><em>qollqas</em></strong>, which were built in the tens of thousands along roadsides in the empire, the Inca relied heavily on manual tools like foot ploughs, hoes, and clod busters to harvest staple crops like maize. </p>

<p>Mesoamerican religions granted great importance to the worship of nature and maize; the saying <em>“(wo)men of maize”</em> is apt as mankind feeds from the grain, which in turn serves as the base for their civilisations. The structure of a life of maize builds upon worldview that organises time and space, and whose recurrent metaphor is this sacred plant’s cycle of life. In this way, deities, rites and ceremonies, festivities and participants, are linked with nature’s rhythms, the cycle of the land and its product: maize.</p>

Therefore, the gods that created it were the object of worship expressed in countless representations. In this way, by cultivating maize, Mesoamerican men and women cultivated themselves.</p>

	<h3>ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE AND BELIEFS</h3>
<p>In the mesoamerican world, scientific knowledge was frequently expressed through religious language. With a profound knowledge of the plant, of the agricultural conditions suitable for growth and the help of simple instruments, the Mesoamerican people developed agricultural systems to obtain the most precious of fruits: maize. Ancient Mexicans expressed their knowledge on the origin of this grain in myths and legends, as a way of transmitting their own experience.</p>

<p>Some of these myths relate the domestication of maize to the origins of civilisation and the appearance of mankind. Among the many versions, ancient and modern, about the origins of maize linked to civilisation, the Legend of the Five Suns (creation myth of the Highplain groups) and the Popol Vuh (foundational myth of the Maya tradition) stand out.</p>

<p>The first refers to the creation of the world and humankind, where maize plays a primordial role.</p>

<p>In the second, humankind is made of maize, after several failed attempts by its creator to achieve the perfect work with other materials. The Mayans put this faith into famous verse, writing one of the most complete cosmogonies of world literature, called the Popol Vuh. A brief look at this story illuminates the important symbol of maize to Mesoamerican people:</p>

<p><em>“Había alimentos de todas clases, alimentos pequeños y grandes, plantas pequeñas y plantas grandes. Los animales enseñaron el camino, y moliendo entonces las mazorcas amarillas y las mazorcas blancas, hizo Ixmucané nueve bebidad, y de este alimento provinieron la fuerza y la gordura y con él crearon los músculos y el vigor del hombre. Esto hicieron los Progenitores, Tepeu y Gucumatz, así llamados.</em></p>

<p><em>A continuación entraron en pláticas acerca de la creación y la formación de nuestra primera madre y padre, de maíz amarillo y de maíz blanco se hizo su carne; de masa de maíz se hicieron los brazos y las piernas del hombre. Únicamente masa de maíz entró en la carne de nuestros padres, los cuatro hombres que fueron creados.”</em></p>

	<h3>THE MILPA: A MESOAMERICAN INVENTION</h3>

<p>In addition to the domestication of maize and the advent of nixtamalization, Mesoamerican groups designed the milpa (from the nahuatl: <em>milli</em> = crops; <em>apam</em> = open field or plan) which is an agricultural ecosystem based on the joint production of maize-beans-squash and has played a decisive part in the conservation and improvement of agricultural diversity and ecology.</p>

<p>In the milpa, every plant has an ecological function. Maize and beans complement each other: the bean plant fixes nitrogen, an essential nutrient required by maize; meanwhile, maize offers a hold upon which the bean plant can climb and support itself as it grows. Squash, being a creeping plant with wide leaves, is grown between the maize and the bean plants to inhibit the growth of weeds and keep the soil moist. Chile, often grown in the milpa, serves as an effective insect repellent.</p>

<h3 class="red">THE MILPA: THE BASIS FOR A BALANCED DIET</h3>
<p>On a nutritional level, the four plants present in the milpa complement each other to offer a diet balanced in amino-acids (granted by maize and beans) and niacin, in carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins and fibre (given by squash) and in the many vitamins (granted by chile). Added to this are the nutrients offered by numerous other plants associated with the milpa such as melon, tomatoes, chilis, sweet potato, jícama, amaranth and mucuna, which envelop an entire orchard and is an adequate way to grow “a bit of everything for the table”.</p>

<h3 class="red">NIXTAMALIZATION</h3>
<p>The treatment of maize with lime, or the hulled of the plant, is important to increase its nutritional value. The exterior covering of the grain is eliminated so that it does not produce indigestion or interferes with the assimilation of other nutrients. The lime and heat used to elaborate the nixtamal provoke chemicals in the maize, and improve its quality by making it more digestible. Nixtamalization significantly improves the bioavailability of calcium and amino-acids. It also represented a technological revolution that allowed Mesoamerican people to improve its quality as food.</p>

	<span class="museo p text animate">
	<p>The discovery of America in 1492 and its subsequent colonization represented to the Europeans the fulfillment and generation of great wealth, including the crops and foods that helped to prevent hunger in various parts of the world.  Among these riches was maize, brought to Europe, to Africa (linked to the slave trade), to the Philippines, to China (by the commercial exchange named the Nao of China) and to India at the start of the sixteenth century. </p>

<p>In all of these regions, since the sixteenth century, maize was well received. In Africa it became a crop of great significance. In India it was rapidly integrated into the gastronomy, along with the chile and the tomato. Thus, by the seventeenth century it was already known and cultivated throughout almost the entire world. Today it dominates large portions of European agriculture, especially for animal feed. The broad and rapid spread of maize prompted a loss of memory on its origins and founders; even today it accrues names like the Turkish grain, Asian fruit, Indian grain, or grain of the Mecca.</p>

<p>Maize is the name of the plant in Spanish. In Nahuatl it is known as teocintle, tlayoli, centli, centi, or cintle;  in Maya, ixi;  in Huasteco, izis; in Otomí or Hñahñu, detha; in Tarasco, xanini or ahtziri; in Quechua, pirissincu; and in Guaraní, abatí.</p>
