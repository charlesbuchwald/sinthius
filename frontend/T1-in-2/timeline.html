	The story of maize and mankind began ten thousand years ago in the Americas. Maize was the common thread guiding the evolution of Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations

	and the new social and economic orders that distinguished them. The introduction of maize and agriculture by pre-hispanic groups left a lasting mark on religion, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, art and agriculture. It is hard to imagine the progress of these cultures without this important plant that became the center of agriculture on the continent. Today maize, along with wheat and rice, is one of the three most widely cultivated grains in the world. It links future generations around the world to the innovation of pre-hispanic farmers.

<p>The first settlers began their journey forty thousand years ago. These nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Strait and moved toward less frigid lands south in the American continent. Between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE however, profound climate changes combined with widespread hunting prompted the extinction of large mammals that once populated the American continent such as mammoths, camel, horses, bison, and mastodons.</p>
<br><br>
<p>These changes led nomadic groups to gradually turn to agriculture, forming small, sedentary communities where, alongside hunting, gathering and fishing, they cultivated and eventually domesticated many of the native plants that are still central to the Mesoamerican diet today—squash, beans, amaranth, and chile plus potatoes and quinoa in the Andean region. Thanks to the ingenuity of the first Mesoamerican farmers, maize would become one of the most important plants in this diverse region and later, in the rest of the world.</p>

Teosinte <em>(Zea mays L. ssp. Parviglumis)</em> is a wild grass that is found  in southern Mexico and Central America. It commonly grows as a wild plant along streams and on hillsides, although it can also invade cultivated fields as a weed. Though Teosinte looks very different from maize <em>(Zea mays L)</em>, it shares certain structural and genetic similarities. Teosinte can cross-breed with modern maize varieties to form maize-teosinte hybrids that can go on to reproduce naturally. However, the edible portion of wild teosinte is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard shell.

	<p>Archeologists believe that maize was first domesticated between 10,000 and 5,500 BCE by nomadic groups who settled along the Balsas river basin--a region that spans the current south-central Mexican states of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Mexico. This transition occurred simultaneously in other communities and may have extended as far south as northern Nicaragua. From these regions, maize rapidly spread throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of maize in historical record challenges the notion that evolution involves gradual changes over long periods of time. Genetic consistency between maize varieties proves that modern varieties descend from a single ancestor. Unlike other plants such as wheat and rice, maize has no obvious wild relatives. It exists only as a cultivated crop that without human intervention to remove and distribute the seeds, they would fall to the ground still attached to the cob and germinate at the same time and place, competing for sunlight and nutrients such that few would survive.</p>

<p>Scientists now believe that the wild ancestor of maize is the <strong>teosinte plant (+)</strong> which means grain of god in Nahuatl.</p>

Early maize (Zea species) pollen dating back to 5100 BCE has been found at the Olmec archeological site at San Andres, Tabasco in south-western Mexico. By 3,000 BCE, there is evidence of maize cultivation in South America, and by 2100 BCE it was introduced to the southwestern United States in areas of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

	<p>In large parts of the current Mexican and Central American territory- a region now known as Mesoamerica- one of the most complex civilisation centres in the history of humankind developed. Those ancient civilisations, much like those of today, were sustained by maize. The permanence of the crop and the culture of maize is one of the links that join the past, present, and surely the future of the groups of people living in these regions.</p> 

<p>Maize was at the center of the Mesoamerican diet: the relationship between these men and women growing this plant gave rise to a common history based on a shared worldview and forms of social organisation that revolved around agriculture. The history of the men and women of these lands with this sacred plant can be synthesised into a phrase that distinguishes them: <em>“We are made of maize… we are people of maize.”</em></p>

<strong>Catal Hayuk</strong> (7500- 5700 BCE) is one of the most impressive early settlements. Located in what is now Anatolia, in southern Turkey, it may have housed up to 10,000 people and is by far the largest Neolithic settlement found to date. Evidence indicates that the people living here depended equally on hunting as on the cultivation of wheat, barley, peas, and lentils. Though sheep and goats were already domesticated, cattle domestication also began to emerge during this time. 
Catal Hayuk is an example of the dramatic ways agriculture transformed social organization. It could even be considered a small city by today’s standards. Unlike Jerf el Ahmar, Catal Hayuk did not appear to have public buildings. Instead, it was composed of individual, but closely constructed domestic structures each containing cooking ovens and hearths. </p>

The Neolithic Revolution is one of the most significant chapters in the history of humanity. It was during this period that art, trade, government, religion, science, and social structures took on forms that have since come to shape the order of life on this planet.  Without a doubt, agriculture is the spool around which further revolutions of humankind were spun, with wheat at the core of many great civilizations.

<h3>SOCIAL STRATIFICATION</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
As agriculture became the engine behind Neolithic societies, lifestyles were increasingly driven by the shifts of the growing seasons. Increased productivity and larger populations required specialized roles and responsibilities assigned to support this labor, while food surpluses and seasonal cycles meant there was more time for other concerns -no longer did everyone in the village need to dedicate themselves to food collection to ensure the community's survival.  
This development paved the way for social stratification not seen before. Settlements like Catal Hayuk, despite its large population for the time, remained surprisingly egalitarian. However, when significant urbanization took place at the start of the Ubaid period (6500 to 3800 BCE), distinct gender roles and class divisions became increasingly predominant.  
<br><br>
Households that once depended on each other for survival became economically independent and competitive as resources such as access to waterways, land and animal ownership, and trade privileges led to differentiated productivity among groups.  
<br><br>
The emergence of a ruling class enforced and negotiated these divisions. Where decisions had once been made by the collective community, chieftains emerged with the authority to mediate conflicts and oversee economic and religious matters. The chieftains evolved into a ruling class with kings and city-states, and by the time of the Sumerians (5,000 BCE- 1750 BCE), there were governments that drafted contracts, established trade, granted land for irrigation, collected taxes, and enforced laws that safeguarded a clearly defined social order.

<h3>TRADE</h3>
<br><br>
<p>
The existence of food surpluses created new opportunities for the evolving communities of the Neolithic era, and organized trade began to emerge, reflecting the needs required by larger populations. The commercial exchange of resources such as metals, animals, food, pottery, and tools demonstrated the sophisticated economic, religious and physical structures these early societies were erecting.   
<br><br>
Trade was carried out with other population centers by specialized merchants, and the waterways of the Tigris and Euphrates rivers enabled the exchange of goods with distant communities. Meanwhile the similar styles of the region’s arts and crafts and common working techniques throughout the Fertile Crescent point to an increasing interdependency and collaboration.

<h3>CUNEIFORM SCRIPT</h3>
<p>
<br><br>
How can we confidently describe the faiths and re-tell the stories of the oldest farmers and civilizations? The answer lies in another remarkable innovation of these Neolithic civilizations: the emergence of the written language. 
<br><br>
To be sure, this written language, called the cuneiform script—meaning ‘wedged-shaped” in Latin— looked much different than our own.  It first took shape in Mesopotamia and consisted originally of pictograms— a series of wedge-shaped marks on clay tablets. Eventually (between 3100 BCE- 2900 BCE) this script became more abstract and included simpler designs pertaining to phonetic sounds.  
<br><br>
Initially, the clay cuneiform tablets served as administrative records listing the cultivation and distribution of grain in the community and the number of cattle and other animals in use. Between half a million and two million cuneiform tablets are estimated to have been excavated in modern times. Nevertheless, only approximately 30,000-100,000 of these have been deciphered. 
<br><br>
The most impressive of these is The Epic of Gilgamesh, which wasn’t deciphered until the 19th century. This Sumerian text, a compilation of many poems written in cuneiform script over the course of 2,000 years (the first one dating back to 2100 BCE) is just one of the many significant legacies left behind by the ancient Sumerians.  No doubt, however, the authors of this early written language still have many stories untold. 
</p>

<div class="scrollhorcont" style="background-image:url(assets/Vessel-copia.png);">

</div>
<div class="scrollhorcont">

<h3>POTTERY</h3>
<p>
<br><br>
The first potter’s wheel emerged during this time, and traces of a diverse array of pottery and other crafts, serving both practical and symbolic functions allowed archaeologists to chart the course of agriculture in Mesopotamia to tell the story of the earliest permanent settlements and their growth into urban centers.  (IMAGE?)
<br><br>
Archeologists have found numerous, hand-crafted pots for cooking and storage, as well as clay figurines depicting the female form that appear to celebrate the harvest. These objects were used in both daily life and in worship, and were often placed in burial chambers where relationships between the afterlife, fertility and death were sown together by the allegory of the harvest, and its vital, life sustaining grains.   
<br><br>
Pottery also reveals the significance of beer to the ancient Mesopotamians. Considered the drink of the gods, it was a staple drink of the ancient Sumerians. Images of people and gods drinking beer through the long straws invented by the Sumerians frequently appear on painted pottery.  (Images?)
<br><br>
Despite the increasing stratification of the later Neolithic period, most of the population still labored as farmers and seasonal pastors, but cities then also contained specialized craftspeople: potters, weavers, and metalworkers whose creativity left an enduring legacy.

<h3>RELIGION</h3>
<p>
<span class="heuristica">
<br><br>
The significance of wheat for these early groups began to shape their religious beliefs. Images of deer, birds, and other animals were common in pre-Neolithic temples, but archaeologists studying Neolithic sites have found papyrus images, crafts and other artifacts showing Mesopotamian deities dedicated to wheat.  
<br><br>
The Sumerian culture (5,000 BCE- 1750 BCE), located in modern day Iraq, was in many ways the culmination of the thousands of years of transformations that evolved over the Neolithic period. It is regarded as the world’s first urban civilization, and they worshipped specific deities such as Enten, a god of irrigation and agriculture and Ashnan, the goddess of grain. Sumerian mythology tells us her mission was to feed humanity.  
<br><br>
The ancient Sumerians also had a goddess of beer, Ninkasi, who was responsible with overseeing the daily preparation of this popular drink. The female association with beer is evidenced in the Sumerian text Hymn to Ninkasi (1800 BCE).   
<br><br>
Wheat and cultivation took on a new and widely diverse symbolism. It is no surprise that the female, associated with procreation, was also associated with wheat and harvest. Agriculture, after all, was directly sustaining the lives of these early peoples. The seasonal cycles of sowing, thrashing, collecting, then re-tilling the soil lent themselves to the emerging concept of reincarnation, rebirth, and continuity between life and death or between generations. These concepts coalesced into religious beliefs, rituals dedicated to the harvest of wheat. Still to this day, death is frequently depicted in many cultures with a scythe—the instrument that is used to sow the vital grain from its stem and which marks the end of a particular growing season.

<h3>LAW MATHEMATICS, SCIENCE</h3>
<p>
<br><br>
The changes brought by agriculture evoked new concepts of time and place.  Life was oriented around the growing seasons of crops like wheat.  By 4000 BCE the Sumerians had developed a complex mathematical measurement system that resulted in the creation of arithmetic, geometry, and algebra as well as a lunisolar calendar.  These measuring tools originally served bureaucratic functions and enabled matters such as crop yields and distributions to be tallied.
New measures for society also became necessary to organize the larger populations. The fortunes of agricultural abundance were coupled with new forms of order ranging from legal codes to military organisation. There is evidence that the Samarra culture had fortified walls and posts on the outskirts of their settlements and by the time of the Sumerians, the first descriptions of warfare were recorded. 
<br>
The Code of Hammurabi (1754 BCE), written in ancient Babylonia, in what is now modern day Iraq, is one of the world’s earliest written legal documents. It defines terms for subjects as diverse as divorce, theft, trade, slander, slavery, animal rental, and the duties of workers. There are even codes for the production and drinking of beer.  This legal code is emblematic of the complexity into which Neolithic societies had developed.
