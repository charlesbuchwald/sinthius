	The story of maize and mankind began ten thousand years ago in the Americas. Maize was the common thread guiding the evolution of Mesoamerican and Andean civilizations

	and the new social and economic orders that distinguished them. The introduction of maize and agriculture by pre-hispanic groups left a lasting mark on religion, mathematics, astronomy, architecture, art and agriculture. It is hard to imagine the progress of these cultures without this important plant that became the center of agriculture on the continent. Today maize, along with wheat and rice, is one of the three most widely cultivated grains in the world. It links future generations around the world to the innovation of pre-hispanic farmers.

<p>The first settlers began their journey forty thousand years ago. These nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Strait and moved toward less frigid lands south in the American continent. Between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE however, profound climate changes combined with widespread hunting prompted the extinction of large mammals that once populated the American continent such as mammoths, camel, horses, bison, and mastodons.</p>
<br><br>
<p>These changes led nomadic groups to gradually turn to agriculture, forming small, sedentary communities where, alongside hunting, gathering and fishing, they cultivated and eventually domesticated many of the native plants that are still central to the Mesoamerican diet today—squash, beans, amaranth, and chile plus potatoes and quinoa in the Andean region. Thanks to the ingenuity of the first Mesoamerican farmers, maize would become one of the most important plants in this diverse region and later, in the rest of the world.</p>

Teosinte <em>(Zea mays L. ssp. Parviglumis)</em> is a wild grass that is found  in southern Mexico and Central America. It commonly grows as a wild plant along streams and on hillsides, although it can also invade cultivated fields as a weed. Though Teosinte looks very different from maize <em>(Zea mays L)</em>, it shares certain structural and genetic similarities. Teosinte can cross-breed with modern maize varieties to form maize-teosinte hybrids that can go on to reproduce naturally. However, the edible portion of wild teosinte is too small and hard to obtain to be eaten directly, as each kernel is enclosed in a very hard shell.

	<p>Archeologists believe that maize was first domesticated between 10,000 and 5,500 BCE by nomadic groups who settled along the Balsas river basin--a region that spans the current south-central Mexican states of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, and Mexico. This transition occurred simultaneously in other communities and may have extended as far south as northern Nicaragua. From these regions, maize rapidly spread throughout the continent.</p>

<p>The sudden appearance of maize in historical record challenges the notion that evolution involves gradual changes over long periods of time. Genetic consistency between maize varieties proves that modern varieties descend from a single ancestor. Unlike other plants such as wheat and rice, maize has no obvious wild relatives. It exists only as a cultivated crop that without human intervention to remove and distribute the seeds, they would fall to the ground still attached to the cob and germinate at the same time and place, competing for sunlight and nutrients such that few would survive.</p>

<p>Scientists now believe that the wild ancestor of maize is the <strong>teosinte plant (+)</strong> which means grain of god in Nahuatl.</p>

<p>Though maize-like plants derived from teosinte were cultivated since 5,000 BCE, the earliest corn cob dates to around 4,250 BCE, found at the <strong>Guila Naquitz Cave</strong> in the Oaxaca Valley. Early maize (Zea species) pollen dating back to 5100 BCE has been found at the Olmec archeological site at San Andres, Tabasco in south-western Mexico. By 3,000 BCE, there is evidence of maize cultivation in South America, and by 2100 BCE it was introduced to the southwestern United States in areas of New Mexico and Arizona.</p>

	<p>In large parts of the current Mexican and Central American territory- a region now known as Mesoamerica- one of the most complex civilisation centres in the history of humankind developed. Those ancient civilisations, much like those of today, were sustained by maize. The permanence of the crop and the culture of maize is one of the links that join the past, present, and surely the future of the groups of people living in these regions.</p> 

<p>Maize was at the center of the Mesoamerican diet: the relationship between these men and women growing this plant gave rise to a common history based on a shared worldview and forms of social organisation that revolved around agriculture. The history of the men and women of these lands with this sacred plant can be synthesised into a phrase that distinguishes them: <em>“We are made of maize… we are people of maize.”</em></p>

<p>As tools and irrigation methods became more sophisticated, agriculture became a central part of the livelihood of nomadic groups in Mesoamerica. This led to food surpluses which encouraged population growth and prompted the emergence of the first permanent settlements around 2300 BCE. This transition took root in the Central High Plateau region of Mexico where access to vital water sources, as well as diverse game for hunting and fishing, encouraged fixed settlements along the lake shores.</p> 

<p>Dwellings made of straw, logs, and mud were grouped together in small villages around which various granaries and hearths were located for storing and preparing food.  These settlements also lay the foundations for the first ceremonial structures. They had a local social and political organization with little hierarchy, and trade between settlements of the Northern (Nexpa, Cuicuilco, Xochipala etal) and Central Plateau (<strong>Monté Alban</strong>, <strong>San Lorenzo</strong>, <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong>, etal) was common. They exchanged raw materials and stones like obsidian which were used for making agricultural tools like axes or decorative items like beads.</p>

<h3 class="orange">OLMEC</h3>
<p>Out of the Central High Plateau arose the notable Olmec culture (1800- 200 BCE) in what is now the south of Veracruz and northern Tabasco regions along the Gulf coast of Mexico. This was considered to be the first civilization in ancient Mexico. By its peak in 700 BCE, urbanization, architectural, and technological innovations illustrate how developments in agriculture prompted an increasingly sophisticated culture that spread over a wide geography.</p> 
<p>The Olmecs established well-planned city-temple complexes like <strong>La Venta</strong> (Tabasco), <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong> (Veracruz), and <strong>San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán</strong> (Veracruz). A priestly class emerged who governed activities related to the veneration of maize and other agricultural symbols which took place in increasingly sophisticated spaces built for ceremonial purposes. Watering and irrigation systems were also developed.</p>

<p>In the western region of the High Plateau, the Chupícuaro culture (800 BCE to 200 CE) established itself along the Lerma River and its tributaries in the modern state of Guanajuato, Mexico. Some groups of nomadic Chichimeca - a diverse group of hunter-gatherers who took advantage of this important water source and shed the nomadic lifestyle, developing agriculture and cultivating maize, beans, and chile.</p> 
<p>They left a diverse array of pottery, often associated with fertility, as well as over ten pyramid temples. During this time, they exercised great influence over a vast territory extending throughout the modern day states of Guanajuato, Michoacán, Guerrero, Mexico, Hidalgo, Colima, Nayarit, Querétaro, and Zacatecas, possibly even extending as far north as the southern United States. </p>

<h3 class="orange">TEOTIHUACAN, CACAXTLA/XOCITECATL, XOCHICALCO</h3>
<p>The great city of <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (100 CE- 750 CE) highlights the increasing urbanization and complexity of Mesoamerican civilizations. This prominent city, located just north of modern day Mexico City, had a population of more than 125,000 by 500 CE and was among the largest cities in the world at the time. It is no wonder that it was named “birthplace of the gods” and exercised power over the region.</p> 
<p>The complex planning and architecture of the site reflected the increasingly structured cosmogony and ceremonial practices. Along with multi-floor residences housing multiple families, long avenues connected imposing pyramids -  temples dedicated to an expanded pantheon of gods. The impressive Temple of the Sun, dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, is the largest of these structures and the third largest pyramid in the world. Tlaloc was frequently depicted alongside maize which was cultivated using the method of chinampas, or raised farm beds.  </p>
<p><strong>Cacaxtla/Xochitecatl </strong>(650-900 CE) in modern day Tlaxcala is another city of regional influence. It had a population of around ten thousand people and conducted extensive trade with other cultures in farther regions. It contained separate residences for a governing elite, or priestly class, and common people who were usually farmers.   </p> 
<p><strong>Xochichalco</strong> (700- 900 CE), in modern day Morelos, held up to twenty thousand people. It contains an array of pyramid temples of similar style to those of Teotihuacan or the Mayans, indicating the increasing communication and trade between the cultures of Mesoamerica. An astronomical observatory highlights the emerging scientific sophistication.  </p>

<p>The militaristic Toltecs (900-1150 CE) based in modern day Hidalgo, replaced Teotihuacán as the dominant city in the region and held influence over a vast portion of southern and central Mexico. Descending from groups of Chichimeca who settled in the region, the Toltecs constructed impressive cities such as Tula, a capital with up to thirty thousand residents, impressive monuments and temples, and dense housing units. Close similarities to the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá point to exchange between these two Mesoamerican empires.</p> 
<p>The Toltecs were known for their impressive maize productivity, and a drying climate was part of the reason for their downfall. They were greatly admired by the later Mexica groups that came to be known as the Aztec Empire.</p>

The Neolithic Revolution is one of the most significant chapters in the history of humanity. It was during this period that art, trade, government, religion, science, and social structures took on forms that have since come to shape the order of life on this planet.  Without a doubt, agriculture is the spool around which further revolutions of humankind were spun, with wheat at the core of many great civilizations.
