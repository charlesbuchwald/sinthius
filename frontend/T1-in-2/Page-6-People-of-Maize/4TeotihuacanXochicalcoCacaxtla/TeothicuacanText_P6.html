<h3><p> TEOTIHUACAN, CACAXTLA/XOCHITECATL, XOCHICALCO</p></h3>

<body>
<p>The great city of <strong>Teotihuacan</strong> (100 CE- 750 CE) highlights the increasing urbanization and complexity of Mesoamerican civilizations. This prominent city, located just north of modern day Mexico City, had a population of more than 125,000 by 500 CE and was among the largest cities in the world at the time. It is no wonder that it was named “birthplace of the gods” and exercised power over the region.</p> 
<p>The complex planning and architecture of the site reflected the increasingly structured cosmogony and ceremonial practices. Along with multi-floor residences housing multiple families, long avenues connected imposing pyramids -  temples dedicated to an expanded pantheon of gods. The impressive Temple of the Sun, dedicated to the rain god Tlaloc, is the largest of these structures and the third largest pyramid in the world. Tlaloc was frequently depicted alongside maize which was cultivated using the method of chinampas, or raised farm beds.  </p>
<p><strong>Cacaxtla/Xochitecatl </strong>(650-900 CE) in modern day Tlaxcala is another city of regional influence. It had a population of around ten thousand people and conducted extensive trade with other cultures in farther regions. It contained separate residences for a governing elite, or priestly class, and common people who were usually farmers.   </p> 
<p><strong>Xochichalco</strong> (700- 900 CE), in modern day Morelos, held up to twenty thousand people. It contains an array of pyramid temples of similar style to those of Teotihuacan or the Mayans, indicating the increasing communication and trade between the cultures of Mesoamerica. An astronomical observatory highlights the emerging scientific sophistication.  </p>
