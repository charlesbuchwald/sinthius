Though einkorn and emmer were essential to humanity in the Fertile Crescent for several millennia, they are now only grown in a few places and are of minor significance. They have largely been replaced by durum (Triticum durum) used for pasta and flat breads, and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum) used for leavened bread, noodles and other baked goods. Both produce higher and more stable grain yields and can produce more widely adapted grain to feed an ever growing human population which has become dependent on these indispensable grains. Today bread wheat comprises nearly 95 percent of the wheat produced  worldwide,  with durum accounting for the remaining 5 percent.
