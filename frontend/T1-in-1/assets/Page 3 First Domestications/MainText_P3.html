<title>The First Domestications</title>

<body>
<p>Before sedentary agriculture was established, nomadic societies had a network of campsites where they would exploit local resources. In the Fertile Crescent, these included wild einkorn, or “single-grain” wheat (Triticum boeoticum) and wild emmer, or hulled wheat (Triticum turgidum ssp. dicoccoides) which grew abundantly in the wild in 10,000 BCE.  </p> 

<p>These early wild populations of wheats had unique characteristics that naturally adapted them to survive in harsh environments. It is thought farmers selected these populations because of their superior grain yield. Over time, sowing and repeated harvesting of select grains led to the development of domesticated strains with altered characteristics that were preferred by farmers. This was an early form of plant breeding.</p> 

<p>Einkorn and emmer were some of the first subjects of this experimentation along with other staple crops such as rye, barley, lentils, flax, and chickpeas. However, the high yield and nutritional value of wheats along with their ease of storage and a moderately short growing season were undoubtedly factors that contributed to their cultivation.</p> 

<p>Other desirable traits included an evenly distributed ripening period and a reduction of the inedible chaff (glumes) and retention of the ripe seeds on the plant. The selected preference towards these or other preferable traits indicates a domesticated variety of cereal. </p>
