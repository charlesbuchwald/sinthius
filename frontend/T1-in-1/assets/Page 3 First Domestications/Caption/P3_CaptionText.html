Archeologists claim the first permanent buildings were constructed for communal or ritual purposes. Examples include Çatalhöyük and Göbekli Tepe (10,000 BCE), both located in what is now south central Turkey. The hundreds of massive, T-shaped stone pillars found at Göbekli Tepe in the Karacadağ mountain range, which is believed to be the place where wheat was first domesticated, were erected by nomadic groups just before the Neolithic era.
