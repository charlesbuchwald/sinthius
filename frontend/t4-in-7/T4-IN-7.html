		<h2>
		ENHANCING CIMMYT’S IMPACT
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	CIMMYT’s major innovation pipelines will have systematically documented theories of change (including social considerations), by applying gender, social inclusion, and poverty lenses and taking into account the geographical and temporal contexts. 
		•	All core products being scaled out will be monitored actively and systematically for quality control, progress, and adoption using poverty- and gender-disaggregated data.
		•	One substantive ex-ante or ex-post study per year will guide research prioritization and document impacts of past research, respectively.
		</p>
		</text>
		<text>
		<h2>
		NOVEL GENETIC DIVERSITY AND TOOLS
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	Germplasm bank accessions will have been phenotyped and genotyped for important traits.
		•	A genetic resources data and informatics platform will be available for breeders worldwide to identify and access valuable diversity for use in developing maize and wheat varieties that address production challenges including those from changing climate.
		•	“Bridging germplasm” that incorporates crucial traits from landraces and unimproved populations – for example, drought tolerance, disease resistance, and heat tolerance – into elite genetic backgrounds will be regularly made available for use in breeding programs.
		•	The efficiency of maize and wheat breeding will be enhanced by tools and methods that enable breeders to readily implement scientific advances in genetics, such as doubled haploids, genomic selection, remote sensing, and bioinformatics.
		•	Modern biotechnology techniques such as gene editing will be applied to develop varieties that address the priorities of resource-poor maize and wheat farmers
		</p>

		<text>
		<h2>
		GIVING FARMERS EASIER ACCESS TO BETTER VARIETIES
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	Increased use of climate-resilient and disease-resistant maize and wheat varieties.
		•	15% increased use of climate-resilient (drought and heat stress tolerant) maize varieties by farmers in the tropics and semi-tropics, including eastern and southern Africa, South Asia and Latin America.
		•	25% increased use of maize varieties that resist Maize Lethal Necrosis (MLN) by farmers in at least 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).
		•	15% increased use of new heat tolerant wheat varieties by farmers in South Asia.
		•	50% increased use of varieties resistant to stem rust pathogen Ug99 and its evolving variants by farmers in eastern Africa, and to new yellow rust races in Central, West, and South Asia and the East African highlands, respectively.
		</p>
		</text>
		<text>
		<h2>
		SUSTAINABLE INTENSIFICATION TO IMPROVE FARMER LIVELIHOODS
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	150% increase in adoption of CIMMYT-developed and/or promoted technologies by farmers in CIMMYT countries of focus.
		•	Sustainable intensification innovations are better known, promoted, and implemented by our key development partners (NARS and NGOs).		
		</p>
		</text>
		<text>
		<h2>
		REACHING THE LAST MILE
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	At least 15% and as many as 70% (depending on the country) of farmers in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Iran, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, and Sudan, plus the Middle East and North Africa, will gain access to seed of most recently developed wheat varieties.
		•	50% increased use of new heat tolerant wheat varieties by farmers in South Asia.
		•	At least 25% increased use of seeds resistant to stem rust pathogen Ug99 and its evolving variants by wheat farmers in eastern Africa and to yellow rust resistant varieties by wheat farmers in Central and South Asia.
		•	Local/regional seed companies will produce and market at least 100,000 tons of quality seed of stress tolerant maize varieties to smallholder farmers in Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
		</p>
		</text>
		<text>
		<h2>
		BOOSTING GOOD NUTRITION AND INCOMES
		</h2>
		<p>
		•	Maize with high kernel lysine, tryptophan, enhanced zinc or provitamin A concentrations, and wheat with high kernel zinc and iron content will be marketed and grown by farmers in priority countries, including Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Honduras, India, Malawi, Mozambique, Nepal, Pakistan, and Zambia.
		•	At least 10-15% increased use of nutritionally enriched maize varieties with high kernel lysine, tryptophan, zinc or pro-vitamin A concentrations.
		•	Crop and diet diversification fostered through sustainable intensification research in maize- and wheat-based agri-food systems in priority countries.
		•	At least five wheat varieties with high zinc levels released in countries where whole grain products are consumed (Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, and Pakistan)
		</p>

		<h2>
		THE “CIMMYT ACADEMY”: A New Dimension of Capacity Building
		</h2>
		<p>
		The “CIMMYT Academy” is a new vision for consolidating our training and capacity building efforts to maximize our impacts in knowledge sharing, teaching, and building an international cadre of top agricultural scientists and development practitioners in collaboration with top universities worldwide. Through the Academy, CIMMYT will maintain productive partnerships with universities, national agricultural research and extension systems, the private sector, and researchers from other organizations. We will enhance our relationship with our alumni and partners, inviting them to participate in relevant CIMMYT meetings and events and act as ambassadors for CIMMYT’s mission.

		•	A 35% increase in the number of Ph.D. students CIMMYT hosts or co-advises.
		•	Establish the CIMMYT Academy as a global brand.
		•	Develop and nurture talent among national researchers and professionals of small- and medium-size enterprises.  
		•	Develop train-the-trainer initiatives and connect local groups of trainers with local projects.
		•	Create a community of practice among trainees for learning and sharing knowledge

<h1><span class="green">FUTURE OF</span>
CIMMYT</h1>
<p>
Feeding the more than 9.5 billion people estimated to occupy the earth by 2050 bodes to be a difficult task. An even greater cooperation between global researchers, partners and donors is critical to continue ensuring sustainable livelihoods for those most affected. CIMMYT is committed to fulfilling more ambitious objectives for research, improved seed varieties and capacity building with systematic assessments of impact along diverse socioeconomic, conservation, grain yield and quality variables. The pressure for ground-breaking innovation in agriculture makes all the more urgent CIMMYT’s deepening investment in the multidisciplinary, integrative research and development partnerships it has fostered for fifty years.  </p>
