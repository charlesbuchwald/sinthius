<h4><strong><em>LONDRES 40</em></strong></h4>

<p>CIMMYT first laid roots near downtown Mexico City, at offices located at Londres 40 in Colonia Juárez. This remained its headquarters from 1963 to 1971 when the Mexican government donated land for a new center called El Batán in Texcoco located in the State of Mexico.</p>
