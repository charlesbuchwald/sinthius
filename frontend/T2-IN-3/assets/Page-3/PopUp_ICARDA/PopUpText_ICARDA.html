<p>The <strong>International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas</strong>, or <strong>ICARDA</strong>, (formerly in Aleppo, Syria, now in Rabat, Morocco) was founded in 1977. It promotes agricultural development and improved livelihoods in non-tropical dry areas of the developing world which are home to 2.5 billion people. Activities include crop improvement research, capacity building and training programs, and the maintenance of a germbank with 148,000 seed collections of unique landraces and wild relatives of cereals, legumes and forages collected from dryland areas worldwide. ICARDA is one of CIMMYTâ€™s primary partners.   </p>
