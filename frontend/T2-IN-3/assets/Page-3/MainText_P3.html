<h1>THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE CGIAR</h1>
<body>


<p>As the mission of centers like CIMMYT grew in scope so too did the operational costs and organizational responsibilities. Robert McNamara, then president of the World Bank, recognized a need for a unifying body to oversee funding and  coordination of the increasingly complex network of international, regional, and national agriculture and development organizations. He also envisioned the expansion of this network to include new research institutes dedicated to growing issues such as water management and livestock in the developing world. </p>

<p>In 1969, McNamara wrote to Addeke H. Boerma, the director-general of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and to Paul G. Hoffman, the administrator of the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) proposing the establishment of a global consortium for this purpose. After two years of discussion and international deliberations known as the First Bellagio Conference, the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research, or CGIAR was formally established in 1971 with the sponsorship of these organizations and the World Bank.</p>

<p><strong>CIMMYT (+)</strong> was one of the first four institutions— along with the <strong>International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) (+)</strong>, <strong>International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) (+)</strong>, and <strong>International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)(+)</strong>— that formed the core of this consortium, all of which were originally funded by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations. These four institutes and those which joined later, including<strong> The International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA)(+)</strong>, would remain autonomous international organizations governed by an international board, but they would now receive funding from a much larger pool of donors.  </p>

<p>Public, private, or commercial funding organizations, with advice from independent scientists, would informally discuss research priorities, investment options and evaluate how resources could best meet the demands of developing technology equipped to increase food production in food-deficient countries of the world. CGIAR now comprises 15 institutions across the globe-- it’s nearly 10,000 scientists and staff in 96 countries work in close collaboration with hundreds of partner organizations and donors. </p>
