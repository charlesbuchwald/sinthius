<p>The <strong>International Center for Tropical Agriculture</strong> (Cali, Columbia), founded in 1967, collaborates with hundreds of partners across the developing world to develop technologies and methods that better enable smallholder farmers to improve crop production, incomes, and management of natural resources. Research includes sustainable management of tropical soils and policy-making to confront challenges such as climate change, environmental degradation, gender inequities, and weak links between farmers and markets. The Center includes 200 scientists who work throughout Latin America and the Caribbean, twenty-eight countries in Africa, and five countries in Southeast Asia. </p>
