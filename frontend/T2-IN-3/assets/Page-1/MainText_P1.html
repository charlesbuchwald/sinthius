<h1>AN INTERNATIONAL CENTER</h1>



<body>
<p>CIMMYT works with more than 300 global partners from the public and private sectors, national institutions, international research organizations and seed companies to mobilize global resources for research and development with the aim of strengthening the strategic impact of farming systems in Asia, Africa and Latin America. </p>

<p>Since its founding in 1966, CIMMYT has assisted countries across the world to establish agricultural research and training programs. These collaborations evolved into the forty-five regional offices which CIMMYT has opened worldwide. These programs have expanded research to address local needs and constraints, creating an ever-evolving pool of technologies, seed varieties and impact studies. The research programs were increasingly important players in harnessing proven technologies to combatting drought, heat, insects and diseases, and poor crop management practices which threaten sustainable agriculture worldwide. CIMMYT is a trusted leader in facilitating this global, cross-disciplinary partnership.</p>
