				The birth of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1700’s altered medicine and living standards, resulting in a population explosion that would steamroll into the 20th century. Between 1900 and 2000 the increase in world population was three times greater than during the entire previous history of humanity. This unprecedented growth threatened the lives of millions of people because of imminent food shortages, especially in developing countries. The monumental task of feeding the world population called for bold new humanitarian initiatives and cooperation between rich and poor nations. In the words of Norman Borlaug, this action was "a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation," a breathing space in which to deal with the "Population Monster" and the subsequent environmental and social ills that too often lead to conflict between men and between nations.
					</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>
				Humanitarian foundations, governments, scientists and farmers came together in the first half of the twentieth century to find ways to conquer hunger. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and its predecessor program the Office of Special Studies (OSS) were pioneers in efforts that would ultimately enable developing nations to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and gain entrance to world markets.  These efforts provided a model that has since been widely adopted by both governments and non-government organizations, making a tangible difference in the lives of millions of people around the world.

			When General <strong>Manuel Ávila Camacho </strong><a class="addCross caption captionText" ref="1"></a> became the President of Mexico on December 1, 1940, he took leadership of a country, that despite progressive reforms from the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), still faced a bleak agricultural future: productivity faltered, infrastructure was lacking, technology and training opportunities were null or insufficient, and Mexico was unable to produce the food it needed.

			Camacho and his cabinet member Marte R.

				Gomez invited Wallace to tour various farming regions of Mexico, to observe agricultural production problems first-hand, and to comment upon the strategies planned to increase production. After traveling and surveying the conditions in the country, Gómez then asked Vice President Wallace for technical assistance from the United States. Wallace invited Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, chairman of the <strong>Rockefeller Foundation</strong><a class="addCross caption captionText" ref="3"></a>, to Washington, D.C. to discuss Mexico’s request. Wallace felt that the Rockefeller Foundation, a well-established philanthropic organization with years of experience helping many countries develop public health programs, would be an ideal partner for this task.

				In 1943 this partnership was officially launched with the establishment of the Oficina de Estudios Especiales (OEE), or Office of Special Studies (OSS), whose goal was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement programs. This project was the cornerstone of the Rockefeller Foundation’s  Mexican Agriculture Program (MAP), and was the start of a nearly twenty year collaboration between the two countries. Under the leadership of the first director, Jacob George Harrar, prominent <strong>American agricultural researchers</strong> <a class="addCross caption captionText" ref="1"></a> were brought to Mexico. They immediately began improvement programs for maize, wheat, and beans and for other important crops like barley, sorghum, potatoes, vegetables, and forage crops. Their early successes transformed agriculture in Mexico and paved the way for what was to become the Green Revolution.  

				A maize <strong>germplasm collection</strong> <a class="addCross caption captionText" ref="2"></a>consisting of Mexican and other Latin American maize landraces was also established in 1943. Today the CIMMYT germplasm bank contains 28,000 maize seed samples and 140,000 wheat seed samples, making CIMMYT the holders of the world’s largest collection of these two crops worldwide. This gene bank preserves the genetic diversity of maize and wheat and is an important resource for crop improvement and research.

				 and climatic diversity which made ideal plant varieties in one region unfit for another. One of the first initiatives of the OSS was to establish a network of experiment stations in distinct regions throughout Mexico. The country’s geographic diversity made it an ideal testbed for researching varieties of plants that could be grown in distinct regions of the globe. These extension stations provided Mexican agronomists with hands-on field experience that had been lacking up to that point in their mostly theoretical education. They also gave local farmers the opportunity to participate in research while learning about the latest cultivation methods that would best support their crops.

	A generation of farmers and Mexican and Latin American agronomists were educated at the various experiment stations as part of a systematic effort to spread  agricultural knowledge beyond the laboratory. Farmers were given the opportunity to actively participate in research, thus acquiring the management skills, access to tools, and familiarity with crop husbandry techniques that they lacked after the agrarian reforms of the Mexican Revolution. 

	</p>

	<p> 
	These sites also formed part of the ambitious effort to replace Mexico’s outdated educational system with a strategic pipeline that trained agronomists in accordance with the country’s specific agricultural needs. It would ensure that promising students had access to the in-depth, cutting-edge training they needed to fill the ranks of universities and governmental agencies capable of sustaining Mexico’s agricultural future.

				The scientists of the Oficina de Estudios Especiales (OEE) recognized the urgency of developing new and improved varieties to curb food shortages associated with population growth. They initiated research, using varieties from throughout  the country and worldwide for crop improvement.  
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> 
				This required meticulous collecting, cataloguing, cultivation and crossing of plants. Research was also subject to time, logistics and funding constraints  with feedback from farmers required to validate their efforts. Eventually these efforts began to bear fruits. By applying technologies like modern irrigation methods, pesticides and fertilizers, higher yielding varieties were successfully bred and grown by farmers.

				The first successful outcomes of extensive cross-breeding research were in maize, a project overseen by Edwin J. Wellhausen, head of the OSS’s maize research division. Wellhausen gathered over 800 Mexican varieties of maize and tested across a variety of conditions from varying temperature and precipitation to differing soil composition and altitude. He quickly achieved improvements to maize grain production simply by distributing the best Mexican maize varieties to farmers in regions that didn’t otherwise have access to them. Afterwards, he planted the best varieties next to each other, allowing natural cross-pollination to occur. The result was two open pollinated varieties. This second crossed line is known as a double-top cross synthetic, which had better yield than  other varieties.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p> 
				By 1947 there were already ten new maize varieties available, and thanks to the Mexican government’s newly created Maize Commission, large-scale distribution of these high performing seeds was made possible. The first widely distributed seed was named “Rocamex” in honor of the joint endeavors of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government. In 1948, only five years after CIMMYT’s pilot program OSS was established, Mexico accomplished its first objective by achieving maize self-sufficiency.

				However, Borlaug made a breakthrough when he imported seeds containing genes from Norin 10, a new variety made by Japanese scientist Gonjoro Inazuka in 1935. This cross between two American wheat varieties and a semi-dwarf (+) Japanese landrace contained two critical genes, Rht1 and Rht2, which made it both shorter in stature, high-yielding, and high-tillering. Inazuka’s cross improved these dwarf varieties by further reducing the average height from 150 to 60-110 cm. This cross quickly attracted international attention and was brought to the United States by Samuel Salmon, a renowned wheat breeder in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). In the late 1940’s researcher Orville Vogel used it to produce high-yielding, semi-dwarf winter wheat varieties.

Borlaug was under pressure by project administrators to rapidly develop improved wheat varieties for Mexican farmers.  To achieve this, he devised sowing and harvesting wheat twice within a 12 month period as various locations, in what has become known as shuttle-breeding. He was able to grow wheat in the Mexican highlands during the summer season and then grow a second crop in northwestern Mexico during the winter, hence doubling the efficiency of breeding new wheat varieties. This ingenious method had never been tried before and was initially dismissed by Borlaug’s OSS director, George Harrar, yet it resulted in broadly adapted, high yielding, disease resistant varieties. Shuttle breeding, effectively unlocked the barriers that had once impeded wheat sustainability on a global scale.

<p>
Originally the National School of Agriculture (ENA), the Autonomous University of Chapingo was founded on February 22, 1854 in the Convent of San Jacinto, in Mexico City bearing the legacy of pre-Revolution Mexico. During the Mexican Revolution, the university was moved to the ex-hacienda of Chapingo, near Texcoco, where it adopted a new slogan: “Teach the use of the earth, not the exploitation of man.” The MAP’s merit-based mentorship of students catalyzed a long-term investment in infrastructure and capacity as it played a significant role in reconstituting this institution from the perspective of both human and agricultural advancement.

The <strong>Mexican Agriculture Program (MAP)</strong> recognized that a vital part of sustaining agricultural advances was building a network of resources from which the next generations of farmers and young researchers could draw. The 150 acres donated by the Mexican government to the Office of Special Studies in 1943 at <strong>Chapingo University <a class="addCross caption captionText" ref="1"></a></strong> served as a base for field experimentation while also offering applied learning opportunities for promising students  
</p>
 
 <h3>Chapingo University Library</h3>
<p>In 1945, Dr. Dorothy Parker established for the MAP a modern research library at Chapingo. It resulted in an impressive collection of 40,000 volumes that attracted researchers from across Latin America and served as a resource for teachers, researchers, students, and officials working within the National Center for Teaching, Research, and Agricultural Extension. In 1966 this library was donated to the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) where it was then transferred to Chapingo University and integrated into the <strong>National Agricultural Library</strong>.</p>

			<h3>Post-graduate program </h3>
<p> 
On February 22, 1959, the Post Graduate School of the National School of Agriculture (later established as an independent institution) was founded, with the goal of advancing higher education in agriculture in Mexico. At first it offered Master’s degrees, but now also offers Ph.D’s. In 1978, the school was formally reestablished as the Autonomous University of Chapingo, which is today considered one of the leading agronomic institutions of higher learning in Latin America.

	THE END...

	AND THE BEGINNING
	</div>

	<div class="museo p text">
			<p> Over the course of twenty years, the Office of Special Studies accomplished groundbreaking  achievements in agricultural research and literally built an entire generation of Latin American agricultural experts from the ground up. Networks such as the Latin American Agricultural Sciences Association (ACLA)  gave continued momentum to the field. Yet dire hunger, famine, and malnutrition coupled by climate variability and inconsistency and deepening economic disparities underscored the need for the OSS to  broaden its agricultural advancements in wheat and maize. In 1960 seeds were made freely available to researchers worldwide through a network of international seed nurseries, and in 1961, the Office of Special studies officially came to a close as the International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT) was born.  </p>
<br>
<p> 
Many of the same researchers who worked with OSS continued their research under CIMMYT.  Dr. Edwin J. Wellhausen, notable maize researcher and the former local director of the OSS, became the first Director General of CIMMYT.  Among the others was Norman Borlaug, who as director of CIMMYT’s Wheat Program, drove the Green Revolution  with the recognition of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize. Many other staff were integrated into the newly established National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) in Mexico, and in 1963 CIMMYT became an international agricultural research for development institution poised to guide agriculture into the twenty-first century.
