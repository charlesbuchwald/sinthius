<h3>STEM RUST</h3>

<body>
<p> 
Rusts proliferate on a variety of grasses including on wheat and often will dramatically reduce grain yields. It can spread rapidly and over large distances by wind. It results in shriveled grains or causes the collapse of the stem that supports them, creating a devastating loss- seventy percent of more of entire crops can perish within a few weeks from harvest.
