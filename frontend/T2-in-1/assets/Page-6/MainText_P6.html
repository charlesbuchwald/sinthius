This required meticulous collecting, cataloguing, cultivation and crossing of plants. Research was also subject to time, logistics and funding constraints  with feedback from farmers required to validate their efforts. Eventually these efforts began to bear fruits. By applying technologies like modern irrigation methods, pesticides and fertilizers, higher yielding varieties were successfully bred and grown by farmers.
