Also called “loved child”; is the stalk of the maize plant when it is green. “Its heart is like jade, green and precious”. Son of Xochiquetzal, another wife of Tlaloc and Piltzintecutli, or “god child” and son of the first man. Born in the  new moon, in Tamoanchan, in a cave, it burrows in the earth. From its hair cotton is born, from one ear the huahzontle, from its nose chia seed, from its fingers squash and from its nails maize. From the rest of its body many other fruits emerge.</p>
