<h2><p>SETTLERS</p></h2>

<body>
<p>The first settlers began their journey forty thousand years ago. These nomadic bands of hunter-gatherers crossed the Bering Strait and moved toward less frigid lands south in the American continent. Between 10,000 and 7,000 BCE however, profound climate changes combined with widespread hunting prompted the extinction of large mammals that once populated the American continent such as mammoths, camel, horses, bison, and mastodons.</p>

<p>These changes led nomadic groups to gradually turn to agriculture, forming small, sedentary communities where, alongside hunting, gathering and fishing, they cultivated and eventually domesticated many of the native plants that are still central to the Mesoamerican diet todayâ€”squash, beans, amaranth, and chile plus potatoes and quinoa in the Andean region. Thanks to the ingenuity of the first Mesoamerican farmers, maize would become one of the most important plants in this diverse region and later, in the rest of the world.</p>
