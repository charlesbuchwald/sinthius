The first successful outcomes of extensive cross-breeding research were in maize, a project overseen by Edwin J. Wellhausen, head of the OSS’s maize research division. Wellhausen gathered over 800 Mexican varieties of maize and tested across a variety of conditions from varying temperature and precipitation to differing soil composition and altitude. He quickly achieved improvements to maize grain production simply by distributing the best Mexican maize varieties to farmers in regions that didn’t otherwise have access to them. Afterwards, he planted the best varieties next to each other, allowing natural cross-pollination to occur. The result was two open pollinated varieties. This second crossed line is known as a double-top cross synthetic, which had better yield than  other varieties.

By 1947 there were already ten new maize varieties available, and thanks to the Mexican government’s newly created Maize Commission, large-scale distribution of these high performing seeds was made possible. The first widely distributed seed was named “Rocamex” in honor of the joint endeavors of the Rockefeller Foundation and the Mexican government. In 1948, only five years after CIMMYT’s pilot program OSS was established, Mexico accomplished its first objective by achieving maize self-sufficiency.
