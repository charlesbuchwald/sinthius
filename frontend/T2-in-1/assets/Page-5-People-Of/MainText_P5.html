<h1><p>PEOPLE</p></h1>
<h2><p>OF MAIZE</p></h2>

<body>
<p>In large parts of the current Mexican and Central American territory- a region now known as Mesoamerica- one of the most complex civilisation centres in the history of humankind developed. Those ancient civilisations, much like those of today, were sustained by maize. The permanence of the crop and the culture of maize is one of the links that join the past, present, and surely the future of the groups of people living in these regions.</p> 

<p>Maize was at the center of the Mesoamerican diet: the relationship between these men and women growing this plant gave rise to a common history based on a shared worldview and forms of social organisation that revolved around agriculture. The history of the men and women of these lands with this sacred plant can be synthesised into a phrase that distinguishes them: <em>“We are made of maize… we are people of maize.”</em></p>
