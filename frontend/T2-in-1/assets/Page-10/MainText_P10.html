<h1>CHAPINGO POSTGRADUATE COLLEGE AND LIBRARY</h1>

<body>
<p>
The <strong>Mexican Agriculture Program (MAP)</strong> recognized that a vital part of sustaining agricultural advances was building a network of resources from which the next generations of farmers and young researchers could draw. The 150 acres donated by the Mexican government to the Office of Special Studies in 1943 at <strong>Chapingo University (+)</strong> served as a base for field experimentation while also offering applied learning opportunities for promising students

 <h3>Chapingo University Library</h3>
<p>In 1945, Dr. Dorothy Parker established for the MAP a modern research library at Chapingo. It resulted in an impressive collection of 40,000 volumes that attracted researchers from across Latin America and served as a resource for teachers, researchers, students, and officials working within the National Center for Teaching, Research, and Agricultural Extension. In 1966 this library was donated to the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) where it was then transferred to Chapingo University and integrated into the <strong>National Agricultural Library</strong>.</p>
 

<h3>Post-graduate program </h3>
<p> 
On February 22, 1959, the Post Graduate School of the National School of Agriculture (later established as an independent institution) was founded, with the goal of advancing higher education in agriculture in Mexico. At first it offered Master’s degrees, but now also offers Ph.D’s. In 1978, the school was formally reestablished as the Autonomous University of Chapingo, which is today considered one of the leading agronomic institutions of higher learning in Latin America.
