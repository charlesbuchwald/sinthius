<h3> AUTONOMOUS UNIVERSITY OF CHAPINGO</h3>

<body>
<p>
Originally the National School of Agriculture (ENA), the Autonomous University of Chapingo was founded on February 22, 1854 in the Convent of San Jacinto, in Mexico City bearing the legacy of pre-Revolution Mexico. During the Mexican Revolution, the university was moved to the ex-hacienda of Chapingo, near Texcoco, where it adopted a new slogan: “Teach the use of the earth, not the exploitation of man.” The MAP’s merit-based mentorship of students catalyzed a long-term investment in infrastructure and capacity as it played a significant role in reconstituting this institution from the perspective of both human and agricultural advancement.  </p>
