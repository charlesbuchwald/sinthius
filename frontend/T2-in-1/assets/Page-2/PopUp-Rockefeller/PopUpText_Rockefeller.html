<h3> THE ROCKEFELLER FOUNDATION
</h3>
<body>
<p>
From their very first grant —to the American Red Cross— through to the present-day initiatives, The Rockefeller Foundation has a legacy of trailblazing new fields, convening unlikely partners, and sparking new innovations that lead to transformative change. The Rockefeller Foundation took part in the modern field of public health, developing vaccines for diseases such as yellow fever and malaria, and partnered with the Mexican government and CIMMYT to spark the Green Revolution.
