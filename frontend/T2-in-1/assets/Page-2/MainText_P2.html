<h1> A TOUR THROUGH THE MEXICAN FARMLANDS
</h1>
<body>
<p>
When General <strong>Manuel Ávila Camacho (+)</strong> became the President of Mexico on December 1, 1940, he took leadership of a country, that despite progressive reforms from the Mexican Revolution (1910-1920), still faced a bleak agricultural future: productivity faltered, infrastructure was lacking, technology and training opportunities were null or insufficient, and Mexico was unable to produce the food it needed.  
</p>
<p>
Camacho and his cabinet member Marte R. Gómez, a distinguished Mexican agronomist and <strong>Secretary of Agriculture and Development (+)</strong>, reached out to Henry Wallace, then Vice-President of the United States. Wallace had attended Camacho’s inauguration and had an extensive background in agriculture himself, having served previously as the U.S. Secretary of Agriculture, as well as being the founder and chairman of Pioneer Hi-Bred Seed and owner/editor of a well-known farming magazine<em> Wallaces Farmer</em>.

Gomez invited Wallace to tour various farming regions of Mexico, to observe agricultural production problems first-hand, and to comment upon the strategies planned to increase production. After traveling and surveying the conditions in the country, Gómez then asked Vice President Wallace for technical assistance from the United States. Wallace invited Dr. Raymond B. Fosdick, chairman of the <strong>Rockefeller Foundation (+)</strong>, to Washington, D.C. to discuss Mexico’s request. Wallace felt that the Rockefeller Foundation, a well-established philanthropic organization with years of experience helping many countries develop public health programs, would be an ideal partner for this task. 
</p>

<p>
In July 1941, the Rockefeller Foundation convened a <strong>group of notable American agricultural scientists (+) </strong> to assess what sort of assistance could be provided.The group traveled large portions of Mexico interviewing farmers, researchers, technicians and agriculture officials. The resulting report, submitted six months later, in autumn of 1941, offered good news for Mexico.
