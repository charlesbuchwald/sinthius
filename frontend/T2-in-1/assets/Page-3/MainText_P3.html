The scientists recognized that Mexico’s largely agriculture-based economy was inefficient and unable to meet the needs of its population due to systemic gaps in education, research, organization, and resources. In their extensive report they recommended that the Rockefeller Foundation send a team of qualified agricultural scientists to Mexico. They would collaborate with the Mexican Secretariat of Agriculture and Development to jointly work to:
</p>



<p>· Develop improved maize, wheat, and bean varieties.	</p>
<p>· Develop improved cropping and production practices (irrigation, pest and disease control, fertilizer use, chemical and mechanical weed control, planting dates, etc.).</p>
<p>· Develop improved plant health practices.</p>
<p>· Aiding in the development of animal husbandry practices.
</p>
<p>· Training Mexican agricultural scientists. </p>

In 1943 this partnership was officially launched with the establishment of the Oficina de Estudios Especiales (OEE), or Office of Special Studies (OSS), whose goal was to ensure food security in Mexico and abroad through selective plant breeding and crop improvement programs. This project was the cornerstone of the Rockefeller Foundation’s  Mexican Agriculture Program (MAP), and was the start of a nearly twenty year collaboration between the two countries. Under the leadership of the first director, Jacob George Harrar, prominent <strong>American agricultural researchers(+)</strong> were brought to Mexico. They immediately began improvement programs for maize, wheat, and beans and for other important crops like barley, sorghum, potatoes, vegetables, and forage crops. Their early successes transformed agriculture in Mexico and paved the way for what was to become the Green Revolution.  

A maize <strong>germplasm collection (+)</strong>consisting of Mexican and other Latin American maize landraces was also established in 1943. Today the CIMMYT germplasm bank contains 28,000 maize seed samples and 140,000 wheat seed samples, making CIMMYT the holders of the world’s largest collection of these two crops worldwide. This gene bank preserves the genetic diversity of maize and wheat and is an important resource for crop improvement and research.
