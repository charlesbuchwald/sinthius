<h3> GERMPLASM 
</h3>
<body>
<p>
<strong>Germplasm</strong> is living tissue from which new plants can be grown. It can be a seed or another plant part--a leaf, a piece of stem, pollen or even just a few cells that can be turned into a whole plant. Germplasm contains the information for a speciesâ€™ genetic makeup, a valuable natural resource of plant diversity. </p>
