<h1> TRAINING AND EXTENSION</h1>

<body>
<p> 
A generation of farmers and Mexican and Latin American agronomists were educated at the various experiment stations as part of a systematic effort to spread  agricultural knowledge beyond the laboratory. Farmers were given the opportunity to actively participate in research, thus acquiring the management skills, access to tools, and familiarity with crop husbandry techniques that they lacked after the agrarian reforms of the Mexican Revolution. 

</p>

<p> 
These sites also formed part of the ambitious effort to replace Mexico’s outdated educational system with a strategic pipeline that trained agronomists in accordance with the country’s specific agricultural needs. It would ensure that promising students had access to the in-depth, cutting-edge training they needed to fill the ranks of universities and governmental agencies capable of sustaining Mexico’s agricultural future. 

</p>
<p> 
Selected graduates from Mexican agriculture schools were invited to work as field  assistants on the 150 acre farm donated to Chapingo University by the Mexican government. Afterwards,  some were sent to the United States to pursue master’s degrees in need-based fields at prestigious universities such as Cornell and Harvard. After applying their studies in Mexico for a time, they were then given the possibility to pursue Ph.D’s at the best universities in their respective fields. 

</p>

<p>By 1961, 750 Mexican technicians had received in-service training, 400 had obtained master’s degrees, and 75 had earned Ph.D.’s The pilot program also trained about 100  scientists from other parts of Latin America, prompting the first Latin American agricultural science meetings which took place in Mexico in 1949 and 1950. These meetings ultimately led to the foundation of the Latin American Agricultural Science Association (ALCA) to which hundreds of Latin American scientists now belong.</p>
