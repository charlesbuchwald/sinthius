<h1>THE POPULATION MONSTER</h1>
<body>
<p>
The birth of the Industrial Revolution in the mid 1700â€™s altered medicine and living standards, resulting in a population explosion that would steamroll into the 20th century. Between 1900 and 2000 the increase in world population was three times greater than during the entire previous history of humanity. This unprecedented growth threatened the lives of millions of people because of imminent food shortages, especially in developing countries. The monumental task of feeding the world population called for bold new humanitarian initiatives and cooperation between rich and poor nations. In the words of Norman Borlaug, this action was "a temporary success in man's war against hunger and deprivation," a breathing space in which to deal with the "Population Monster" and the subsequent environmental and social ills that too often lead to conflict between men and between nations.

Humanitarian foundations, governments, scientists and farmers came together in the first half of the twentieth century to find ways to conquer hunger. The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) and its predecessor program the Office of Special Studies (OSS) were pioneers in efforts that would ultimately enable developing nations to achieve self-sufficiency in food production and gain entrance to world markets.  These efforts provided a model that has since been widely adopted by both governments and non-government organizations, making a tangible difference in the lives of millions of people around the world.
