<h1>THE END… AND THE BEGINNING</h1>

<body>
<p> Over the course of twenty years, the Office of Special Studies accomplished groundbreaking  achievements in agricultural research and literally built an entire generation of Latin American agricultural experts from the ground up. Networks such as the Latin American Agricultural Sciences Association (ACLA)  gave continued momentum to the field. Yet dire hunger, famine, and malnutrition coupled by climate variability and inconsistency and deepening economic disparities underscored the need for the OSS to  broaden its agricultural advancements in wheat and maize. In 1960 seeds were made freely available to researchers worldwide through a network of international seed nurseries, and in 1961, the Office of Special studies officially came to a close as the International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT) was born.  </p>

Many of the same researchers who worked with OSS continued their research under CIMMYT.  Dr. Edwin J. Wellhausen, notable maize researcher and the former local director of the OSS, became the first Director General of CIMMYT.  Among the others was Norman Borlaug, who as director of CIMMYT’s Wheat Program, drove the Green Revolution  with the recognition of the 1970 Nobel Peace Prize. Many other staff were integrated into the newly established National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) in Mexico, and in 1963 CIMMYT became an international agricultural research for development institution poised to guide agriculture into the twenty-first century.
