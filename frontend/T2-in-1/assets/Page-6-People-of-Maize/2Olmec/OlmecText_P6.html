<h3><p>OLMEC</p></h3>

<body>
<p>Out of the Central High Plateau arose the notable Olmec culture (1800- 200 BCE) in what is now the south of Veracruz and northern Tabasco regions along the Gulf coast of Mexico. This was considered to be the first civilization in ancient Mexico. By its peak in 700 BCE, urbanization, architectural, and technological innovations illustrate how developments in agriculture prompted an increasingly sophisticated culture that spread over a wide geography.</p> 
<p>The Olmecs established well-planned city-temple complexes like <strong>La Venta</strong> (Tabasco), <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong> (Veracruz), and <strong>San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n</strong> (Veracruz). A priestly class emerged who governed activities related to the veneration of maize and other agricultural symbols which took place in increasingly sophisticated spaces built for ceremonial purposes. Watering and irrigation systems were also developed.</p>
