<h3><p>INCA</p></h3>

<body>
<p>The <strong>Inca civilization</strong> (around 1200-1572 CE) established the largest empire in all of Pre-Columbian America. The capital, Cusco, in modern day Peru, contained up to 300,000 residents at its peak and was a city of bureaucrats, guards, servant-slaves, and laborers brought in from conquered territories. The Inca dominated over a vast region extending down the Andean mountains and including large parts of modern Ecuador, Bolivia, northwest Argentina, north and central Chile, and a small part of Columbia.</p> 
<p>The Inca empire was ruled like a modern federal system, with strong powers in Cusco and regional governments in the four sections of the empire communicating back to the capital. A tax system was in place as well as a standing military composed of male heads of household who were required to serve.</p>
<p>Cities like Machu Picchu, built high in the Andes mountains are emblematic of the technological and organizational feats of the Incas. An extensive network of roads was constructed to allow for the transportation of food and goods throughout the empire. They also created a complex system of terracing, canals, irrigation networks, and draining of wetlands in order to sustain farming in an otherwise mountainous terrain. The Incas were fully aware of the values of regular crop rotation and fertilized land with dried llama dung and other animal remains. In addition to a highly orchestrated system of food storage centers called <strong><em>qollqas</em></strong>, which were built in the tens of thousands along roadsides in the empire, the Inca relied heavily on manual tools like foot ploughs, hoes, and clod busters to harvest staple crops like maize. </p>
