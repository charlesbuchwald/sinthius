<h3><p> CENTRAL HIGH PLATEAU</p></h3>

<body>
<p>As tools and irrigation methods became more sophisticated, agriculture became a central part of the livelihood of nomadic groups in Mesoamerica. This led to food surpluses which encouraged population growth and prompted the emergence of the first permanent settlements around 2300 BCE. This transition took root in the Central High Plateau region of Mexico where access to vital water sources, as well as diverse game for hunting and fishing, encouraged fixed settlements along the lake shores.</p> 
<p>Dwellings made of straw, logs, and mud were grouped together in small villages around which various granaries and hearths were located for storing and preparing food.  These settlements also lay the foundations for the first ceremonial structures. They had a local social and political organization with little hierarchy, and trade between settlements of the Northern (Nexpa, Cuicuilco, Xochipala etal) and Central Plateau (<strong>Mont√© Alban</strong>, <strong>San Lorenzo</strong>, <strong>Tres Zapotes</strong>, etal) was common. They exchanged raw materials and stones like obsidian which were used for making agricultural tools like axes or decorative items like beads.</p>
