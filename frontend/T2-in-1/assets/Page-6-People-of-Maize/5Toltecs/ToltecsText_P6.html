<h3><p>TOLTECS</p></h3>

<body>
<p>The militaristic Toltecs (900-1150 CE) based in modern day Hidalgo, replaced Teotihuacán as the dominant city in the region and held influence over a vast portion of southern and central Mexico. Descending from groups of Chichimeca who settled in the region, the Toltecs constructed impressive cities such as Tula, a capital with up to thirty thousand residents, impressive monuments and temples, and dense housing units. Close similarities to the Mayan city of Chichén Itzá point to exchange between these two Mesoamerican empires.</p> 
<p>The Toltecs were known for their impressive maize productivity, and a drying climate was part of the reason for their downfall. They were greatly admired by the later Mexica groups that came to be known as the Aztec Empire.</p>
