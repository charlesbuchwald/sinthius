<h3><p>MEXICA</p></h3>

<body>
<p>The Mexica civilization, commonly referred to as the Aztec empire, were another prominent civilization that arose, though much later than the Maya. The Mexica were the last of a series of Nahuatl-speaking peoples who moved from the north into the Valley of Mexico around the thirteenth century. Through a series of conquests, their capital of Tenochtitl√°n-- the now dry lake bed where Mexico City stands-- became part of a triple alliance of city-states which governed a vast expanse of central Mexico up until the time of the Spanish conquest in 1521. These city-states formed a hegemonic military confederation known for its violent conquest of other regions.  Political power was divided between supreme rulers in the capital, military executives, and provincial rulers in conquered city states that paid tributes to the main governing body. A judicial system was established to decide matters pertaining to social, economic, and military laws.</p> 
<p>The cultivation of maize was equally woven through Mexica society. They continued using the <em>chinampa</em> method begun in Teotihuacan to cultivate this important crop, which was celebrated for nearly three sacred calendar months every year. Mexica cities were noted for their large plazas in front of the temples that celebrated deities including the multiple gods dedicated to maize. </p>
