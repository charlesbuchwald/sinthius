<h3><p>MAYA</p></h3>

<body>
<p>The Maya civilization was one of the most prominent and enduring Mesoamerican cultures. It spanned nearly two thousand five hundred years, emerging alongside agriculture around 2000 BCE and remaining a regional power up until 1697 CE with the Spanish conquest. Maya cities like Chichén Itzá are known for their monumental architecture, but unlike other Mesoamerican cultures, their population centers were not cohesively linked into one empire. Instead, a variety of states and chiefdoms frequently competed with one another. Their culture was highly hierarchical, with a divine king who derived power from the maize gods. A sociopolitical and military elite occupied administrative buildings which were located at the heart of Maya cities and often served ceremonial purposes associated with religion and seasonal celebrations of maize. Residential areas where farmers and other artisans lived extended outward from the monumental center. Though these laborers constituted ninety percent of the population, they were at the bottom of the social hierarchy.</p> 
<p>The Maya were great innovators: their many accomplishments range from a sophisticated calendar and astronomy to one of the most sophisticated ancient written languages, among many others. Although they traded extensively and over vast regions of Central and Mesoamerica, agriculture was a central feature of their economy. They are also renowned for farming methods such as the <em>milpa</em> system and irrigation techniques accomplished by tapping local underground caves called <em>cenotes</em>. </p>
