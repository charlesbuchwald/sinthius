<h3>THE DOUBLE WHEAT SEASON AND SHUTTLE BREEDING</h3>

<body>
<p> 
Borlaug was under pressure by project administrators to rapidly develop improved wheat varieties for Mexican farmers.  To achieve this, he devised sowing and harvesting wheat twice within a 12 month period as various locations, in what has become known as shuttle-breeding. He was able to grow wheat in the Mexican highlands during the summer season and then grow a second crop in northwestern Mexico during the winter, hence doubling the efficiency of breeding new wheat varieties. This ingenious method had never been tried before and was initially dismissed by Borlaugâ€™s OSS director, George Harrar, yet it resulted in broadly adapted, high yielding, disease resistant varieties. Shuttle breeding, effectively unlocked the barriers that had once impeded wheat sustainability on a global scale.
