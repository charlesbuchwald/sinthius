</head><h1><p>CULTURE</p></h1>
<h2><p>OF MAIZE</p></h2>

<p>The history of maize and the Mesoamerican people are one and the same. Maize became the central axis of diverse groups which developed and faded throughout the length and breadth of the current Mexican territory and Central America over four thousand years. In spite of the differences in economic, and cultural power, and the ecological characteristics of their territories, all these groups grew maize in their different geographic locations.</p>

<p>Evidence testifies to the flourishing of these societies, which while maintaining their local peculiarities, remained strongly tied to a common history: the agrarian tradition associated to the milpa way of farming (maize - beans - squash), the binding worldviews, and the presence of similar deities in their religious pantheons. According to the Toltec, Zapotec, Mexica or Maya foundational myths, maize (the matter from which mankind was created) is a divine gift. Therefore, the gods that created it were the object of worship expressed in countless representations. In this way, by cultivating maize, Mesoamerican men and women cultivated themselves.</p>
