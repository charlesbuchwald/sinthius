<body>

<p>Thousands of years before the European conquest of the New World, maize grew throughout the continent. From its place of origin (central-western Mesoamerica), it spread via two routes. First, across and down the length of this territory and much later, to western North America; shortly after, it spread down the eastern coasts of what is now the United States and Canada. It’s second route ran across the Antilles (from where it gets its most common name), until landing in South America, especially in the Andes. Some argue that the return of more resistant varieties of maize to Mesoamerica and improved varieties in the lowlands of the continent and in the heights of the Andes, had the effect of increasing productivity and reinforcing urbanization in these regions at the end of the pre-hispanic era.</p>

<p>The diffusion of maize throughout the world began shortly after the conquest.  Columbus introduced maize to Europe towards the end of the fifteenth century. At the start of the sixteenth century, maize arrived to Asia via the Mediterranean, the Indian Ocean, and via the Philippines and Indonesia. During the same time, it arrived in Africa via Spain and Italy, and much later to Brazil and the Guayanas. Nevertheless, the spread of maize across the world, unaccompanied by the technology of nixtamalization, was rejected as a human food and used only for animal feed. Compared with wheat and rice-- the other two grains spread most widely throughout the world--, maize remains a low-cost crop.</p>

<p>Maize is the name of the plant in Spanish. In Nahuatl it is known as teocintle, tlayoli, centli, centi, or cintle;  in Maya, ixi;  in Huasteco, izis; in Otomí or Hñahñu, detha; in Tarasco, xanini or ahtziri; in Quechua, pirissincu; and in Guaraní, abatí.</p>
