<h3><p>ANCIENT KNOWLEDGE</p></h3></head>

<body>

<p>In the mesoamerican world, scientific knowledge was frequently expressed through religious language. With a profound knowledge of the plant, of the agricultural conditions suitable for growth and the help of simple instruments, the Mesoamerican people developed agricultural systems to obtain the most precious of fruits: maize. Ancient Mexicans expressed their knowledge on the origin of this grain in myths and legends, as a way of transmitting their own experience.</p>

<p>Some of these myths relate the domestication of maize to the origins of civilisation and the appearance of mankind. Among the many versions, ancient and modern, about the origins of maize linked to civilisation, the Legend of the Five Suns (creation myth of the Highplain groups) and the Popol Vuh (foundational myth of the Maya tradition) stand out.</p>

<p>The first refers to the creation of the world and humankind, where maize plays a primordial role.</p>
