<h3><p>THE MILPA: A MESOAMERICAN INVENTION</p></h3>

<body>

<p>In addition to the domestication of maize and the advent of nixtamalization, Mesoamerican groups designed the milpa (from the nahuatl: <em>milli</em> = crops; <em>apam</em> = open field or plan) which is an agricultural ecosystem based on the joint production of maize-beans-squash and has played a decisive part in the conservation and improvement of agricultural diversity and ecology.</p>

<p>In the milpa, every plant has an ecological function. Maize and beans complement each other: the bean plant fixes nitrogen, an essential nutrient required by maize; meanwhile, maize offers a hold upon which the bean plant can climb and support itself as it grows. Squash, being a creeping plant with wide leaves, is grown between the maize and the bean plants to inhibit the growth of weeds and keep the soil moist. Chile, often grown in the milpa, serves as an effective insect repellent.</p>
