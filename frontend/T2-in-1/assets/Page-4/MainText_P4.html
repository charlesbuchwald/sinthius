<h1> THE EXPERIMENT STATION SYSTEM 
</h1>
<body>
<p>
The Rockefeller Report drew particular attention to the lack of applied, practical field work at Mexican agricultural schools and the failures of research to take into consideration geographic and climatic diversity which made ideal plant varieties in one region unfit for another. One of the first initiatives of the OSS was to establish a network of experiment stations in distinct regions throughout Mexico. The country’s geographic diversity made it an ideal testbed for researching varieties of plants that could be grown in distinct regions of the globe. These extension stations provided Mexican agronomists with hands-on field experience that had been lacking up to that point in their mostly theoretical education. They also gave local farmers the opportunity to participate in research while learning about the latest cultivation methods that would best support their crops.

Many of the original experimental stations remain some of the most important nationwide. These stations, each bearing unique climate, soil, and geographic characteristics, enabled research into new growing methods.

<p>· Campo El Horno, near Chapingo, Edo. Mexico established in 1944.</p>

<p>· La Cal Grande, near La Piedad, Michoacán, established in 1952.</p>

<p>· Campo del Valle del Yaqui, near Ciudad Obregón, Sonora established in 1955. As a further honor the experiment station was renamed Campo Experimental Norman E. Borlaug (<strong>CENEB</strong>) in 2010.  </p>

<p>· Cotaxtla, near Veracruz, established in 1955.</p>

<p>· El Cayal, near Campeche, established in 1957.</p>

<p>· La Campana, near Chihuahua, established in 1958.</p>

<p>The OSS also operated the Santa Elena Experiment Station, established in 1952 in cooperation with the State of Mexico and collaborated at other stations in León, Guanajuato; Xalostoc, Morelos; and El Mexe, Hidalgo. </p>
