		<p>The International Center for the Improvement of Wheat and Maize (CIMMYT) was established in 1966 with the recognition that prior achievements in agriculture were merely the beginning of a much larger undertaking. During the twenty years of the pilot program, trial experiments to improve Mexico’s agricultural productivity were astoundingly successful, but much of the developing world still faced severe poverty and hunger.</p> 
		<br><br>
		<p>The Center was inaugurated alongside one of the most daunting tasks yet: South Asia was facing a catastrophic food shortage, and around the world, in Africa and in other parts of Latin America, the threat of similar crises was almost inevitable. The scientific advances of the past would now have to be reconciled with political and humanitarian negotiations on a grand scale in order to save millions of lives.</p> 
		<br><br>
		<p>This was the start of a new form of diplomacy—one in which CIMMYT scientists, armed with technologies, seeds, and cultivation methods developed over the previous twenty years, sought out farmers and researchers in distant countries with the confidence that similar results could be achieved as in Mexico. In a rapid chain of events, successes in one country provoked adoption of the same methods in others propelling a wave of agricultural productivity that was previously unimaginable. CIMMYT became the engine behind an emerging international network that was replacing predictions of mass devastation with agricultural abundance in a turnaround that came to be called the Green Revolution.</p>

		<p>In 1953, Borlaug had been meticulously crossing-breeding native Mexican wheat varieties for nearly ten years on the hunt for a rust-resistant, high yielding variety adaptable to the local region. A semi-dwarf variety developed by Japanese scientist Gonjoro Inazuka called Norin 10 had been in existence for almost twenty years, but it was only after Borlaug thought to introduce its genes into the Mexican germplasm that his research finally picked up momentum.</p> 
		<br><br>
		<p>Borlaug imported a cross between Norin 10 and a high yielding American cultivar called Brevor 14-- a semi-dwarf hybrid developed by Orville Vogel in the United States. By cross-breeding this hybrid with his own disease-resistant varieties, Borlaug successfully produced wheat varieties adapted to tropical and sub-tropical climates that were also equipped to ward off rust. By 1956 Mexico had become self-sufficient in wheat and by 1962, two high-yielding, semi-dwarf derivatives of Norin 10 which were also rust resistant and developed by Borlaug, were released for commercial production. These new varieties known as Pitic 62 and Penjamo 62 further increased spring wheat yield so that by 1963, ninety-five percent of Mexico’s wheat crops used Borlaug’s semi-dwarf varieties and Mexico had become a net exporter of wheat.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>One year later, in 1964, four other high-yield varieties were released: Lerma Rojo 64, Siete Cerros, Sonora 64, and Super X, as well as another amber, semi-dwarf variety, Sonalika, which quickly became popular in India after its 1971 introduction there and was the variety most responsible for sustaining the Green Revolution in that country.

		<p>In 1943, the same year as CIMMYT’s pilot program OSS was founded, halfway across the globe the world’s worst recorded food disaster was occurring in British-ruled India. A staggering four million people died of hunger in that single year in eastern India (including modern day Bangladesh). The Great Bengal Famine, as it is known, still haunted India after the country’s 1947 independence from Great Britain. Millions of dollars invested by the Rockefeller Foundation towards research and improvements to India’s agricultural infrastructure in the 1950’s were not enough to overcome the hurdles of food shortage in this nation which had the highest population growth rate in the entire world during that decade.</p> 
		<br>
		<p><strong>In 1959 M.S. Swaminathan</strong>, an assistant cytogeneticist at the Indian Agricultural Research Institute in New Delhi and advisor to the Indian Ministry of Agriculture,  reached out to Norman Borlaug. Both scientists recognized the potential of the semi-dwarf Mexican wheat variety to rescue India from worsening famine and were undeterred by the political maneuvering between nations and general resistance to Borlaug’s new, though now well-proven methods. Swaminathan promptly invited Borlaug to India, and in 1963, along with Dr. Glenn Anderson, the trio spent one month traveling India, meeting with government officials and thousands of farmers countrywide, promoting Borlaug’s high-yielding, disease-resistant semi-dwarf varieties.</p> 
		<br>
		<p>By 1965, Borlaug’s grassroots efforts had not only swayed traditional farmers but also convinced the Indian government which requested 250 tons of the Sonora 64 and the Lerma Rojo hybrid varieties to be delivered to India for trials, demonstrations, and distribution to 5000 farmers. These varieties had immediate success and the next year the government requested nearly 5000 tons of wheat. The rapid achievements in India prompted neighboring Pakistan to follow suit, so that by 1966, nearly 15 million combined tons of wheat were imported by these two countries alone. In a few short years, India and Pakistan increased their yields seven to ten fold, surpassing hopes of self-sufficiency and becoming net exporters of wheat while also saving millions of lives. This became known as the Green Revolution.</p>

		<p>Thanks to the twenty years of research and discoveries by scientists in the Office of Special Studies, Mexico had improved its wheat yield by an astounding 600 percent and became a net exporter of both wheat and maize. The original germplasm bank was rapidly expanding into a worldwide collaboration which had successfully overcome new strains of rust and developed maize and wheat adapted to different geographies. The agricultural infrastructure in Mexico had also developed such that new Mexican agencies like the National Agricultural Research Institute (INIA) were equipped to oversee future research independently.  Just as the pilot program was poised to end its formal operations in 1961, Mexican president Lopez Mateos visited the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in South East Asia, which was revolutionizing research in rice breeding. When the director of the program revealed that the institute was modeled after the Mexican agricultural program, Mateos returned to Mexico with the idea that the pilot program should be refashioned as an international center for wheat and maize research, thus ensuring that other countries would benefit from its impact.</p>

	<p>CIMMYT began in 1963 as a new cooperative program with the Mexican Ministry of Agriculture. However, in order to address the scope of the worldwide need, CIMMYT was formally re-established in 1966 as an international non-profit scientific institution governed by an international board of directors and having freedom to operate independent of Mexican institutions. Significant funding was received from the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations, but CIMMYT was now also able to receive additional funding from any agency worldwide wishing to invest in their latest and more ambitious mission of conquering world hunger.  While the underlying objectives remained the same—investing in crop-breeding, educational, and research infrastructures; training farmers in irrigation methods; the strategic use of fertilizers and pesticides— new regional programs were established to support country-specific needs. CIMMYT would also work in collaboration with other worldwide partners in agriculture and development to ensure research was not repeated, new ideas were shared efficiently, and innovation would be maximized to meet the urgency of the world food crisis.</p>

	<h3>IR8 MIRACLE RICE</h3>
	<p>In 1960, U.S. scientists, backed by the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, established the International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) in the Philippines which sought to replicate the impressive results of wheat and maize breeding programs with rice. These researchers imported 10,000 varieties of rice which were cross-bred using Borlaug’s shuttle breeding method. In 1966 they developed the IR8 miracle rice—a short-straw, non-lodging, and rapidly maturing variety that when grown in heavily irrigated conditions, doubled the typical rice yield. This variety was rapidly sent free of cost to Asian countries that were dependent on this crop and facing severe drought and famine. India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, China, Brazil, Argentina, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Malaysia, Korea, Burma, and the United States have all benefitted from the IR8 miracle rice and IRRI agricultural methods.</p>

				<p>The striking impact of CIMMYT research which expanded the world germplasm for wheat and maize, drew more attention to the shortages still threatening vast regions of the globe. As part of its founding mission, CIMMYT sought to target those world regions whose maize production— critical not only for feeding exploding populations, but increasingly also for animal feed and industrial purposes— still lagged. While Mexico’s average yield had increased by 85 percent from 1930-34 and yield in the United States, Canada, and Europe soared, in tropical and semi-tropical regions maize production had hardly changed since the start of the pilot program’s initial research in the 1940’s.</p> 
				<br><br>
				<p> To address this need, cooperative programs were established in Africa, Asia, and in South and Central America which included the development of research and training programs as well as initiatives to alter traditional cultural practices that impeded the rapid application of new and proven technologies. Of the 250 known Latin American maize varieties, five elite cultivars were identified to strategically increase yield in those regions with ongoing need. Country-specific breeding programs in these countries led to new varieties that could eventually be cross-bred. This encouraged the development of new experimental cultivars to keep pace with the growing demand for maize, emerging plant diseases, and shifting environmental conditions in different parts of the world.</p>

Just two years after CIMMYT’s establishment, in 1968, the Mexican government granted land for a new headquarters in El Batán, located 45 km from downtown Mexico City in the State of Mexico. Land was also granted for additional experiment stations in other regions of the country. These sites were selected specifically for their geographic and climatic similarity to other parts of the developing world where advances in research were being directed to curb widespread food shortages. They also supported methods like shuttle breeding which were critical to expedite research. Together, these six research stations o er a portrait of the versatile environments in which wheat and maize are grown and the diverse populations they sustain.
